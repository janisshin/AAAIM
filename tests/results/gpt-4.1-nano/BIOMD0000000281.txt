Reason: The species are mostly well-known metabolites or enzyme complexes involved in glycolysis and related pathways. Some abbreviations are ambiguous but are associated with common metabolic intermediates or cofactors. ENG and ETZ are enzyme intermediates, and their exact chemical names are less certain, so "UNK" is used when appropriate.
