ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP']

Reason: The species are mostly related to cyclic AMP, a well-known signaling molecule, and various components of the PTS glucose transport system, which are standard biochemical entities. Pyr, Glc6P, Glucose, and ATP are common metabolites. The complex species are likely protein complexes or gene products, but without specific names, they are best represented by their general biochemical identities.
