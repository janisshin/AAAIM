Synonyms:
s_glu: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
s_pyr: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate ion']
s_acetald: ['acetaldehyde', 'ethanal', 'acetaldehyde (ethanal)']
s_EtOH: ['ethanol', 'ethyl alcohol', 'alcohol']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid gas']
Red: ['NADH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NADH']
S_f: ['glucose feed', 'glucose feedstock', 'glucose input']

Reason: All species are biochemical compounds involved in yeast metabolism; "s_glu" and "s_pyr" are common metabolic intermediates, "s_acetald" and "s_EtOH" are key in fermentation, "CO2" is a gaseous byproduct, "Red" is a coenzyme in redox reactions, and "S_f" is a substrate feed.
