Synonyms:
X0: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
X1: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
X2: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'glucose 6-phosphate']
X3: ['glucose-1-phosphate', 'G1P', 'glucose 1-phosphate']
X4: ['uridine diphosphate glucose', 'UDP-glucose', 'UDP-glucose']
X6: ['trehalose-6-phosphate', 'T6P', 'trehalose 6-phosphate']
X7: ['trehalose', 'maltose', 'mycose']

Reason: The model describes the trehalose cycle in yeast, with X0 and X1 as glucose, X2 and X3 as phosphorylated glucose intermediates, X4 as UDP-glucose, X6 as trehalose-6-phosphate, and X7 as trehalose.
