Synonyms:
DRG_GDP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP']
GDP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', 'guanosine diphosphate']
DRG_GTP: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP']
GTP: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', 'guanosine triphosphate']
G_GDP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP']
G_GTP: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP']

Reason: The species are likely guanine nucleotide forms involved in GTPase activity; "DRG" is not a standard abbreviation, but the context suggests they are related to GTP/GDP.
