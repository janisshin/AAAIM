Synonyms:
Cytosolic_Rapamycin: ['rapamycin', 'sirolimus', 'rapamune']
mTOR_Rapamycin: ['mTOR inhibitor', 'rapamycin', 'sirolimus']
mTORC1_Rapamycin: ['mTORC1 inhibitor', 'rapamycin', 'sirolimus']

Reason: All species involve rapamycin interacting with mTOR complexes; "rapamycin" and "sirolimus" are common synonyms. The cytosolic form refers to rapamycin localized in the cytosol, and the others are specific to mTOR complexes targeted by rapamycin.
