Synonyms:
Pyranine_single_compartment_model: ['pyranine', 'fluorescent pH indicator', 'UNK']
Pyranine_three_compartment_model_compartment_1: ['pyranine', 'fluorescent dye', 'UNK']
Pyranine_three_compartment_model_compartment_2: ['pyranine', 'fluorescent dye', 'UNK']
Pyranine_three_compartment_model_compartment_3: ['pyranine', 'fluorescent dye', 'UNK']

Reason: All species are labeled as Pyranine, a known fluorescent dye used as a pH indicator. The model suggests compartments within a cell or system, but no specific chemical modifications or synonyms are provided. Therefore, "pyranine" and related common names are most appropriate; "UNK" is used when uncertain.
