Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', 'triphosphate nucleotide']
PCr: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate', 'PCr']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', 'diphosphate nucleotide']
Cr: ['creatine', 'creatine', 'UNK']
Pi: ['inorganic phosphate', 'phosphate', 'Pi']
CTcap: ['muscle total creatine', 'muscle creatine pool', 'total creatine in capillaries']
CTtis: ['tissue total creatine', 'tissue creatine pool', 'total creatine in tissue']
CFcap: ['muscle free creatine', 'capillary free creatine', 'free creatine in capillaries']
CFtis: ['tissue free creatine', 'tissue free creatine', 'free creatine in tissue']

Reason: All species are standard biochemical entities involved in energy metabolism and creatine phosphate shuttle; abbreviations are mapped to common names or synonyms. Cr is ambiguous but most likely creatine.
