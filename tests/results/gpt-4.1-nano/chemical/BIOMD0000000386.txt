Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose bisphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'PGA']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced NADP']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']
O2: ['oxygen', 'O2', 'dioxygen']

Reason: All species are key metabolites or gases involved in the Calvin cycle. RuBP and PGA are well-known intermediates, NADPH is a common cofactor, and CO2 and O2 are gaseous substrates/products. The synonyms reflect standard biochemical nomenclature.
