Reason: All species are related to fatty acid metabolism intermediates, primarily acyl-CoA derivatives, which are well-characterized molecules. The names match known fatty acyl-CoA species, coenzymes, and related metabolites. "AcetylCoAMAT" is explicitly acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite. "FADHMAT" and "NADHMAT" are reduced cofactors. "CarCYT" and "CoACYT" are carnitine and CoA, respectively, involved in fatty acid transport and activation. The other species are chain-length specific acyl-CoA derivatives.
