c2: ['EGFR', 'ErbB1', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor']
c3: ['EGF', 'Epidermal growth factor', 'EGF ligand']
c4: ['EGFR', 'ErbB1', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor']
c10: ['EGFR', 'ErbB1', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor']
c11: ['EGF:ErbB1:ATP', 'EGF-ErbB1 complex', 'EGF bound to ErbB1']
c285: ['Inhibitor', 'Inh', 'Receptor inhibitor']
c462: ['PIP3', 'Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate', 'PIP3 lipid']
c500: ['EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh', 'Ligand-inhibitor complex', 'EGF-ErbB1-ATP with inhibitor']

Reason: The species are components of the ErbB signaling pathway, with c2, c3, c4, c10 representing EGF and its receptor, c11 as ligand-receptor complex, c462 as PIP3, c285 as an inhibitor, and c500 as a complex involving ligand, receptor, ATP, and inhibitor.
