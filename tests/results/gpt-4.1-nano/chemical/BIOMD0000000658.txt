Synonyms:
TCF: ['T-cell factor', 'TCF transcription factor', 'TCF family protein']
B_catenin_TCF: ['beta-catenin/TCF complex', 'beta-catenin TCF', 'beta-catenin transcription complex']

Reason: TCF is a transcription factor activated by beta-catenin in Wnt signaling; B_catenin_TCF represents their complex. Both are key signaling molecules, not small molecules.
