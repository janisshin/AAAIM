Synonyms:
GLC: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
G6P_F6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'F6P']
F6P: ['fructose-6-phosphate', 'F6P', 'hexose phosphate']
FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBP', 'F1,6BP']
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'G3P', 'glyceraldehyde phosphate']
DHAP: ['dihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'DHAP', 'dihydroxyacetone phosphate']
DHAP_G3P: ['DHAP-G3P pool', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate pool', 'glycolytic intermediates']

Reason: All species are glycolytic intermediates or related molecules; GLC is glucose, the primary substrate; G6P and F6P are phosphorylated sugars; FBP is a key glycolytic intermediate; G3P and DHAP are triose phosphates; DHAP_G3P is a pool of these two.
