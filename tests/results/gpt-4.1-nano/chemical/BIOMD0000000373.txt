Synonyms:
c: ['cytosolic calcium', 'Ca2+ (cytoplasmic)', 'free calcium']
cer: ['ceramide', 'cer', 'sphingolipid']
g6p: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'glucose-6-phosphate']
fbp: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBP', 'fructose 1,6-bisphosphate']
adp: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', 'adenine nucleotide']

Reason: The species are common biochemical entities involved in cellular metabolism and signaling. "c" likely refers to cytosolic calcium, "cer" to ceramide, "g6p" to glucose-6-phosphate, "fbp" to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and "adp" to adenosine diphosphate.
