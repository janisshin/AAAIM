Reason: These species are all related to fatty acid β-oxidation intermediates, primarily acyl-CoA derivatives, which are well-known molecules in lipid metabolism. The abbreviations and suffixes indicate chain length and functional groups, matching known fatty acyl-CoA compounds and related cofactors.
