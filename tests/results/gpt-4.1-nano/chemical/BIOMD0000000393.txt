Synonyms:
SBP: ['sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate', 'sedoheptulose bisphosphate', 'S7P']

Reason: S7P is sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, a common Calvin cycle intermediate; SBP is sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate, a related sugar phosphate.

S7P: "sedoheptulose-7-phosphate", "S7P", "sedoheptulose phosphate"
Reason: S7P is a well-known Calvin cycle metabolite.

ATP: "adenosine triphosphate", "ATP", "adenosine triphosphate"
Reason: Standard energy currency molecule.

ADP: "adenosine diphosphate", "ADP", "adenosine diphosphate"
Reason: Standard nucleotide involved in energy transfer.

NADPH: "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced)", "NADPH", "reduced NADP"
Reason: Electron donor in Calvin cycle and biosynthesis.

Pi: "inorganic phosphate", "Pi", "phosphate"
Reason: Common inorganic phosphate.

CO2: "carbon dioxide", "CO2", "carbon dioxide"
Reason: Main substrate for Calvin cycle fixation.

GLYc: "glycolate", "glycolic acid", "UNK"
Reason: Likely a typo or shorthand for glycolate, involved in photorespiration.

SERc: "serine", "serine", "UNK"
Reason: Standard amino acid, involved in photorespiration.

SucPc: "sucrose phosphate", "sucrose-6-phosphate", "SucP"
Reason: Likely sucrose-6-phosphate, a precursor in sucrose biosynthesis.

NADH: "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced)", "NADH", "reduced NAD"
Reason: Electron carrier in metabolic pathways.

GLUc: "glucose", "glucose", "UNK"
Reason: Likely glucose, a primary carbohydrate.

Pic: "phosphatidylinositol", "PI", "phosphatidylinositol"
Reason: Commonly abbreviated as Pic, but context suggests phosphatidylinositol.

PiTc: "inorganic phosphate (cytoplasm)", "Pi", "cytoplasmic phosphate"
Reason: Phosphate in cytoplasm.

ATPc: "adenosine triphosphate (cytoplasm)", "ATP", "cytoplasmic ATP"
Reason: ATP in cytoplasm.

ADPc: "adenosine diphosphate (cytoplasm)", "ADP", "cytoplasmic ADP"
Reason: ADP in cytoplasm.

PiPic: "inorganic phosphate (plastid)", "Pi", "plastid phosphate"
Reason: Phosphate in plastids.

Reason: The species are mostly well-known metabolites involved in photosynthesis, Calvin cycle, and related pathways. Some abbreviations are inferred based on context and common biochemical nomenclature.
