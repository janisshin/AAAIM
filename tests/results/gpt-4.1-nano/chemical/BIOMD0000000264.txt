Synonyms:
EGFR_i: ['epidermal growth factor receptor', 'EGFR', 'HER1']
EGF_EGFR_i: ['EGF-EGFR complex', 'EGF receptor complex', 'EGF bound EGFR']

Reason: EGFR_i likely refers to the epidermal growth factor receptor, a well-known cell surface receptor; EGF_EGFR_i suggests a complex of EGF with EGFR, a common ligand-receptor pair in signaling pathways. No other chemical entities are indicated; thus, these are the most relevant standardized names.
