Synonyms:
incAMP: ['cyclic AMP', 'cAMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"]
excAMP: ['extracellular cAMP', 'cyclic AMP', 'cAMP']

Reason: Both are likely forms of cyclic AMP, with incAMP possibly indicating intracellular and excAMP extracellular; these are common synonyms for cAMP molecules involved in signaling pathways.
