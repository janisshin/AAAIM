Synonyms:
Gt: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', 'guanosine triphosphate']
Gd: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', 'guanosine diphosphate']
LRGt: ['Labeled GTP', 'GTP analog', 'GTP']
RGd: ['Regulator GTP', 'GTP-bound regulator', 'GTP']
RGt: ['Regulator GTP', 'GTP-bound regulator', 'GTP']
LRGd: ['Labeled GTP', 'GTP analog', 'GTP']

Reason: These species are involved in G-protein signaling; Gt and Gd are likely GTP and GDP, respectively. The others are labeled or regulator forms, all related to GTP or its derivatives.
