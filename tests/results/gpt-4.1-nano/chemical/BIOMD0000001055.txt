Synonyms:
Glucose: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Phosphoenolpyruvate: ['phosphoenolpyruvate', 'PEP', '2-phosphoenolpyruvate']
Pyruvate: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate ion']
Oxaloacetate: ['oxaloacetate', 'oxaloacetate ion', '2-oxobutanoate']

Reason: The species are key metabolites in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. Glucose is a common sugar, PEP and pyruvate are well-known glycolytic intermediates, and oxaloacetate is a TCA cycle intermediate. The reactions confirm their identities as standard biochemical compounds.
