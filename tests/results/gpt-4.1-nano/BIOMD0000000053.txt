Synonyms:
Glucose: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Lysine: ['lysine', 'L-lysine', 'aminohexanoic acid']
Glyoxal: ['glyoxal', 'ethanedial', 'glyoxal']

Reason: The model involves known biochemical reactions where glucose and lysine are substrates, and glyoxal is a reactive aldehyde intermediate. The reactions suggest typical metabolic or glycation pathways, supporting these standard names.
