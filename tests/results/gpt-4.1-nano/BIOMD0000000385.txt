Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose bisphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'PGA']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced NADP']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']
O2: ['oxygen', 'O2', 'dioxygen']

Reason: These are key metabolites in the Calvin cycle, with standard biochemical names and common synonyms. NADPH and NADP are related redox cofactors; CO2 and O2 are gases involved in the reactions; PGA and RuBP are well-known Calvin cycle intermediates.
