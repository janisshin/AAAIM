Synonyms:
EC: ['endoplasmic calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
Z: ['calcium release channel', 'ryanodine receptor', 'IP3 receptor']
A: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'inositol trisphosphate']
Y: ['UNK']

Reason: EC and Z are involved in calcium signaling, with EC likely representing calcium ions and Z representing calcium release channels. A is identified as IP3, a well-known signaling molecule. Y is unspecified and no display name provided; thus, "UNK".
