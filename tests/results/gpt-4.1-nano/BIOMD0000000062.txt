Synonyms:
Ts: ['tryptophan', 'L-tryptophan', 'indole-3-pyruvic acid']
Tt: ['total tryptophan', 'L-tryptophan', 'indole-3-pyruvic acid']

Reason: Both species refer to tryptophan, with Tt indicating total (including synthesized) tryptophan, and Ts specifically the synthesized form. The model context suggests they are related to tryptophan molecules.
