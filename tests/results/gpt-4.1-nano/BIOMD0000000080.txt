Synonyms:
DRG_GDP: ['dinitrogen glycine diphosphate', 'UNK', 'UNK']
G_GDP: ['guanine diphosphate', 'GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate']
GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', 'guanyl diphosphate']
DRG_GTP: ['dinitrogen glycine triphosphate', 'UNK', 'UNK']
GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', 'guanyl triphosphate']
G_GTP: ['guanine triphosphate', 'GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate']

Reason: The species appear to be nucleotide derivatives involved in GTP/GDP cycling, with "GTP" and "GDP" being standard nucleotides. "DRG" likely refers to a specific protein or complex, not a chemical entity, so "DRG_GDP" and "DRG_GTP" are uncertain; "GTP" and "GDP" are well-established.
