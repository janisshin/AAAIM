X_gut: ['unknown', 'UNK', 'digestive tract content']
C_p: ['caffeine', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine', 'coffee caffeine']
C_per: ['caffeine metabolite', 'paraxanthine', '1,7-dimethylxanthine']
C_e: ['caffeine', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine', 'coffee caffeine']
C_t: ['caffeine', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine', 'coffee caffeine']

Reason: All species are model variables representing caffeine and its compartments; "X_gut" is a placeholder for gut content, which is not a chemical entity, hence "UNK". The others are directly related to caffeine, a well-known chemical compound.
