Synonyms:
Gsa_gdp_cell: ['G protein alpha subunit GDP', 'Gα-GDP', 'G protein alpha subunit GDP']
Gsa_gtp_cell: ['G protein alpha subunit GTP', 'Gα-GTP', 'G protein alpha subunit GTP']
ATP_cell: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'adenosine triphosphate (ATP)']
cAMP_cell: ['cAMP', 'cyclic AMP', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate']
DMNB_cAMP_cell: ['DMNB-cAMP', 'dinitromethylbenzyl-cAMP', 'cyclic AMP derivative']

Reason: The species are related to signaling molecules and G-protein subunits. Gsa_gdp_cell and Gsa_gtp_cell are G protein alpha subunits in GDP and GTP forms, respectively. ATP_cell and cAMP_cell are well-known nucleotides involved in signaling pathways. DMNB_cAMP_cell is a derivative of cAMP, likely a modified form used in experiments.
