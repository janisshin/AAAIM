Reason: 
- Many species are standard metabolites like glucose phosphates, pyruvate, and common cofactors.
- "cpep" and "cpyr" are well-known central metabolites.
- "fer", "fer_ext", "fercoa", "ferdicoa" relate to iron complexes, common in biochemical contexts.
- "cur" and "cur_ext" refer to curcumin, the product of the pathway, matching the article context.
- Species with empty display names are annotated based on their reaction roles or are ambiguous, hence "UNK" not used here.
