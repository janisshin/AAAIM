Reason: All are standard biochemical names or common synonyms for the respective metabolites, suitable for ontology lookup. Species like _3PGA, Rul5P, and others are well-established metabolites. "Gly_e" and "Gly3P" are recognized as extracellular glycine and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, respectively. "TSH2" and "TS2" are thiosulfate species. "O2" and "CO2" are standard gases. "NADP/NADPH/NADH" are redox cofactors. "ATP/ADP/AMP" are nucleotides. No ambiguous or non-chemical species are present.
