Synonyms:
Glu: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Formic_acid: ['formic acid', 'methanoic acid', 'formate']
Acetic_acid: ['acetic acid', 'vinegar acid', 'ethanoic acid']
lys_R: ['lysine residue', 'lysine side chain', 'L-lysine']

Reason: The model involves common biochemical compounds; Glu is glucose, a central sugar; Formic_acid and Acetic_acid are well-known organic acids; lys_R likely refers to a lysine residue, a common amino acid side chain in proteins.
