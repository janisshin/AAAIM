Synonyms:
ADPi: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP']
ATPi: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP']
Cri: ['creatine', 'creatine']
PCri: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate', 'PCr']
PCr: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate', 'PCr']
ADP: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP']
ATP: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP']
Cr: ['creatine', 'creatine']
Pi: ['inorganic phosphate', 'phosphate', 'Pi']
P: ['phosphate', 'Pi', 'inorganic phosphate']

Reason: The model involves energy transfer molecules and metabolites related to creatine kinase activity; ADPi and ATPi are likely phosphorylated forms of ADP and ATP, respectively; Cri and PCri are creatine and phosphocreatine; Pi and P are inorganic phosphate species. "UNK" is not appropriate as these are well-known energy metabolites.
