Synonyms:
PyrPI: ['pyridoxal phosphate', 'PLP', 'pyridoxal phosphate']
EIICBPGlc: ['glucose-specific phosphotransferase system enzyme IIBC component', 'EIICB', 'glucose transporter']
PEP: ['phosphoenolpyruvate', 'PEP', 'enolpyruvate']
Pyr: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate anion']
GlcP: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'glucose-6-phosphate']
Glc: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']

Reason: The species are likely involved in a bacterial phosphotransferase system and central metabolism; PEP and Pyr are key metabolic intermediates, while Glc and GlcP are related to glucose uptake and phosphorylation. EIICBPGlc is a component of the glucose transport system.
