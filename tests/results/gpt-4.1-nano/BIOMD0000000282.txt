Synonyms:
x: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'H2O2', 'peroxide']
p: ['enzyme-substrate complex', 'catalase-hydrogen peroxide complex', 'ES complex']
p1: ['product 1', 'oxygen', 'O2']
a: ['electron donor', 'reducing agent', 'AH2']
p2: ['product 2', 'water', 'H2O']

Reason: The species p, p1, and p2 are explicitly named as enzyme-substrate complex and products, respectively, with p1 and p2 corresponding to typical reaction products. x is hydrogen peroxide, the substrate for catalase. a is an electron donor involved in the reaction.
