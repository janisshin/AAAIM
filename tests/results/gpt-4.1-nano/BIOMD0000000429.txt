Synonyms:
species_1: ['glycerol', 'glycerin', 'UNK']
species_13: ['UNK']

Reason: species_1 is labeled as "Glyin" which appears to be a misspelling of "Glycerin" or "Glycerol," both common names for a key osmolyte in yeast osmoadaptation. species_13 is "Glyex," which does not correspond to a known chemical; no further context is provided, so it is annotated as "UNK."
