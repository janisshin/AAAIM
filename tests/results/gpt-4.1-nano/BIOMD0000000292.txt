Synonyms:
NADPH: ['NADPH', 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced)', 'NADPH']
ADP: ['ADP', 'Adenosine diphosphate']
ATP: ['ATP', 'Adenosine triphosphate']
X: ['UNK']
Y: ['UNK']
NADP: ['NADP', 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']

Reason: NADPH and NADP are the reduced and oxidized forms of NADP, respectively; ATP and ADP are well-known nucleotides involved in energy transfer. X and Y are unspecified species with no clear chemical identity provided, thus annotated as "UNK".
