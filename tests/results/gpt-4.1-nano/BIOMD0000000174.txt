Synonyms:
r5: ['Rab5-GTP', 'Rab5', 'RAB5']
R5: ['Rab5-GTP', 'Rab5', 'RAB5']
r7: ['Rab7-GTP', 'Rab7', 'RAB7']
R7: ['Rab7-GTP', 'Rab7', 'RAB7']

Reason: The species are the GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms of Rab5 and Rab7, which are well-known small GTPases involved in endosomal trafficking. The notation r and R likely denote GDP- and GTP-bound states respectively, so the standardized names reflect their active/inactive forms.
