Synonyms:
G1: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T1: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'energy currency']
G2: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T2: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'energy currency']

Reason: G1 and G2 are labeled as glucose, a primary substrate in glycolysis. T1 and T2 are labeled as ATP, the main energy molecule involved in the reactions. The model focuses on glycolytic oscillations, which involve these key metabolites.
