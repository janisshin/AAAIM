Synonyms:
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'G3P']
PYR: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', 'PYR']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP']
NADHm: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced)', 'NADH']
NADHc: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced)', 'NADH']
Cam: ['calmodulin', 'calcium/calmodulin', 'CaM']

Reason: G3P and PYR are well-known metabolic intermediates; ATP is a primary energy currency; NADHm and NADHc are cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of NADH, respectively; Cam likely refers to calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein.
