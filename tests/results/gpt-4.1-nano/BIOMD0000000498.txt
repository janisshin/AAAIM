Synonyms:
species_24: ['ferritin', 'ferric iron complex', 'Fe-FT']
species_26: ['ferritin', 'ferric iron complex', 'Fe-FT']
species_5: ['heme', 'hemoglobin', 'porphyrin']
species_2: ['labile iron pool', 'free iron', 'Fe(II)']
species_43: ['transferrin-iron complex', 'Fe-transferrin', 'transferrin-bound iron']
species_12: ['transferrin-iron-transferrin receptor complex', 'Tf-Fe-TfR', 'transferrin receptor complex']
species_15: ['transferrin-iron-transferrin receptor complex', 'Tf-Fe-TfR', 'transferrin receptor complex']
species_16: ['transferrin-iron-transferrin receptor complex', 'Tf-Fe-TfR', 'transferrin receptor complex']
species_19: ['transferrin-iron-transferrin receptor complex', 'Tf-Fe-TfR', 'transferrin receptor complex']

Reason: The model focuses on iron metabolism, with species representing iron complexes, transferrin, and heme. "species_24" and "species_26" are ferritin-related, "species_5" is heme, "species_2" is free or labile iron, and the others are transferrin-iron complexes or receptor-bound forms.
