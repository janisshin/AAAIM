Reason: All species are central metabolites or signaling molecules in bacterial metabolism; synonyms are based on common biochemical names. "ACT" and "ACoA" are both acetyl-CoA derivatives, "GLC" is glucose, "AKG" is alpha-ketoglutarate, etc. Some species like CraFBP and CrpcAMP are regulatory molecules related to their respective metabolites. "PdhRPYR" is pyruvate, a key metabolic intermediate.
