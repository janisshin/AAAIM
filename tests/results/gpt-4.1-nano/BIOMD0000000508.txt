Synonyms:
ip3: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'InsP3']
atp: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP']
y: ['UNK']
ca: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']

Reason: ip3 is a well-known second messenger involved in calcium release; atp is a common energy currency; ca refers to calcium ions, central to the model's focus; y is unspecified and no context provided, so annotated as "UNK".
