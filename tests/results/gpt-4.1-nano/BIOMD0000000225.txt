Synonyms:
GLC: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
G6P_F6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'hexose phosphate']
F6P: ['fructose-6-phosphate', 'F6P', 'hexose phosphate']
FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBP', 'F1,6BP']
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'G3P', 'GA3P']

Reason: The abbreviations GLC, G6P, F6P, FBP, and G3P are standard shorthand for these key glycolytic intermediates. GLC is commonly used for glucose; G6P and F6P are well-known phosphorylated sugars in glycolysis; FBP is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; G3P is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
