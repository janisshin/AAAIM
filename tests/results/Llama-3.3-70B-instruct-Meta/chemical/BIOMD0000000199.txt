Synonyms:
FeIII: ['ferric ion', 'iron(3+)', 'Fe3+']
FeII: ['ferrous ion', 'iron(2+)', 'Fe2+']
FeII_O2: ['UNK']
FeIII_star: ['UNK']
FeII_star: ['UNK']
FeII_star_O2: ['UNK']
FeIII_NO: ['UNK']
FeII_NO: ['UNK']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'O2']
citrulline: ['citrulline', 'L-citrulline', '2-amino-5-ureidopentanoic acid']
NO3: ['nitrate', 'nitrate ion', 'NO3-']
NO: ['nitric oxide', 'nitrogen monoxide', 'NO']
NADPplus: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADP+', 'oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']
FeIII_t: ['UNK']

Reason: The species with "_star" or "_O2" or "_NO" suffixes are likely intermediate or complex forms of iron, but their exact chemical structures are unclear, so they are annotated as "UNK". FeIII and FeII are clearly ferric and ferrous ions, respectively. NADPH and NADPplus are well-known biochemical compounds. O2 is oxygen, citrulline is an amino acid, NO3 is nitrate, and NO is nitric oxide. FeIII_t is unclear without more context, so it is also annotated as "UNK".
