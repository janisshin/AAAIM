Synonyms:
Zn_2: ['zinc(2+)', 'zinc ion', 'Zn²⁺']

Reason: Zn_2 is likely to represent zinc ions with a +2 charge, given the context of zinc homeostasis and the display name 'Zn^2'. The reactions and notes also support this interpretation, mentioning zinc influx and efflux, as well as the involvement of zinc-responsive regulators.
