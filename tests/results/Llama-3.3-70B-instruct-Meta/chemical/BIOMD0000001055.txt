Synonyms:
Glucose: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Phosphoenolpyruvate: ['phosphoenolpyruvate', 'PEP', '2-phosphoenolpyruvate']
Pyruvate: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
Oxaloacetate: ['oxaloacetate', 'oxaloacetic acid', '2-oxosuccinic acid']

Reason: The model is based on glucose metabolism, and the reactions provided match known glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, allowing for confident identification of the species as common intermediates in these pathways.
