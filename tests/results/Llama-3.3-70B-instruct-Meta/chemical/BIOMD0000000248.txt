Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
PCr: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate', 'phosphocreatine ion']
Cr: ['creatine', 'creatinine', 'methylguanidineacetic acid']
Pi: ['inorganic phosphate', 'phosphate ion', 'orthophosphate']
CTcap: ['UNK']
CTtis: ['UNK']
CFcap: ['UNK']
CFtis: ['UNK']

Reason: ATP, ADP, PCr, Cr, and Pi are well-known biochemical compounds with established standardized names, while CTcap, CTtis, CFcap, and CFtis appear to be model-specific variables representing concentrations of oxygen in blood and tissue, and do not have direct chemical counterparts.
