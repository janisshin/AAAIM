Synonyms:
Glucose_G: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood glucose']

Reason: Glucose_G is likely to be glucose, a common energy source for cells, given its role in the model as a regulated substance and its mention in the abstract as a means to activate miR-451 in the up-stream pathway of the model. The display name 'Glucose G' also directly suggests this identification.
