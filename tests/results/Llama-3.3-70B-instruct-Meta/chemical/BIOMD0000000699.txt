Bfa1P5_Tem1GDP: ['UNK']

Reason: The Tem1GTP and Tem1GDP species can be annotated with GTP and GDP respectively, as they are likely referring to the guanosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate states of the Tem1 protein. The other species are annotated as "UNK" because they appear to be protein complexes or modified proteins, which are not directly equivalent to chemical entities that can be looked up in ChEBI.
