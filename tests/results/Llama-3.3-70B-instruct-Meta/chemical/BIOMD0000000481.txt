Synonyms:
E2: ['estradiol', '17beta-estradiol', 'oestradiol']
P4: ['progesterone']
OT: ['UNK']
PGF: ['prostaglandin F2alpha', 'dinoprost', 'prostaglandin F2α']

Reason: E2 is likely estradiol due to its involvement in the bovine estrous cycle. P4 is likely progesterone, a key hormone in the estrous cycle. OT has no clear mapping to a known chemical entity. PGF is likely prostaglandin F2alpha due to the model name mentioning synchronization with prostaglandin F2α.
