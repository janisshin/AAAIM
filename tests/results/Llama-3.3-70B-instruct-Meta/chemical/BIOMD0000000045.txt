Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium(2+)', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
Z: ['calcium(2+)', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
Y: ['calcium(2+)', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
X: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'inositol trisphosphate']

Reason: The model is about calcium oscillations and the reactions suggest that EC, Z, and Y are likely to be calcium ions, given the context of the model and the reactions involving them. X is likely to be inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) due to its role in calcium signaling and the mention of "Ca(2+)-activated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))" in the model description.
