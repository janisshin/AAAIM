Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding biochemical names based on the context of the pentose phosphate pathway model, where E4P, G6L, NADPH, P6G, R5P, Ru5P, S7P, X5P, NADP, G6P, F6P, and GAP are known intermediates or cofactors in the pathway. The standardized names were chosen based on common usage in biochemical literature and databases such as ChEBI.
