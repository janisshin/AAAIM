Reason: The display names provided in the model directly map to standardized names for most species, with some requiring additional context from the model's description and biochemical knowledge, such as the stereochemistry (e.g., L-aspartyl phosphate) or the specific form of the molecule (e.g., NADP+, NADPH). The model's context, including the reactions and the focus on threonine synthesis, supports these annotations. Phos is inferred to be inorganic phosphate based on common usage in biochemical models.
