Synonyms:
Gp: ['glutamate', 'L-glutamic acid', 'glutamic acid']
Gi: ['glutamate', 'L-glutamic acid', 'glutamic acid']
A: ['ammonia', 'ammonium', 'nitrogen oxide']

Reason: Gp and Gi are likely to be glutamate due to the reaction names "The_uptake_of_glutamate_and_Consumption_of_glutamate_and_ammonia" and "Diffusion_of_glutamate", and the consumption of Gi to produce A suggests a conversion of glutamate to ammonia, making A likely to be ammonia.
