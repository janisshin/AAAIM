Synonyms:
G_GDP_cyto: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
ATP_cyto: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
AMP_cyto: ['AMP', 'adenosine monophosphate', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]
cAMP_cyto: ['cAMP', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cyclic AMP']

Reason: The species names suggest involvement in cellular signaling and energy transfer, with "G_GDP_cyto" likely referring to guanosine diphosphate, "ATP_cyto" and "AMP_cyto" referring to adenosine triphosphate and monophosphate respectively, and "cAMP_cyto" referring to cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a key second messenger in cellular signaling.
