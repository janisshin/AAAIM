Reason: The species were identified based on their display names and the context of the liver iron metabolism model. species_24 is likely ferritin due to its reaction with FT1 and the production of iron-ferritin. species_26 is likely FT1, a ferritin light chain. species_5 is clearly heme, given its display name. species_2 is likely a lipid or lipid droplet, given its involvement in reactions with ferritin and heme. species_43 is likely transferrin-iron, given its reactions with TfR1 and TfR2. The other species are identified based on their display names and reactions, with species_12, 15, 16, and 19 being various complexes of transferrin, iron, and TfR1 or TfR2. species_11 is likely intercellular heme, given its reaction with species_5.
