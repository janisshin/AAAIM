RasGDP: ['ras protein, GDP-bound', 'ras-GDP', 'GDP-bound ras']

PIP3: ['phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate', 'inositol trisphosphate', 'PIP3']

Reason: The model is a MAPK signaling pathway model, and the species names are based on common biological abbreviations and terminology. The reactions and display names provide context for the species, allowing for the assignment of standardized names or common synonyms. For example, AktPIP3 is likely phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) due to its reaction with P_I, and RasGDP and RasGTP are likely ras protein in its GDP-bound and GTP-bound states, respectively, due to their reactions with each other.
