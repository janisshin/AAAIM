Reason: The model is based on the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is a series of biochemical reactions that occur in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria to fix carbon dioxide into organic compounds. The species names are annotated based on their roles in the cycle and common biochemical nomenclature. SBP and S7P are intermediates in the cycle, while ATP, ADP, NADPH, and NADH are energy transfer molecules. Pi, CO2, and phosphate-related species are inorganic compounds involved in various reactions. Amino acids like GLYc, SERc, and GLUc are likely involved in related metabolic pathways. SucPc is a sucrose derivative, and the 'c' suffix may indicate a specific compartmentalization or complex. The 'c' and 'Tc' suffixes in other species may also indicate compartmentalization or transport across membranes.
