Synonyms:
STAT3uStattic: ['STAT3', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3', 'STAT3 protein']

Reason: The species name 'STAT3uStattic' seems to be a modified or inhibited form of STAT3, a transcription factor, given the context of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network and the mention of 'Stattic', a known STAT3 inhibitor.
