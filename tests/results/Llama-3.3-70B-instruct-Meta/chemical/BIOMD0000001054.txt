Synonyms:
FM: ['fibrin monomer', 'fibrin', 'fibrinogen']
C1: ['fibrinogen', 'factor I', 'clottable protein']
C2: ['fibrin polymer', 'fibrin clot', 'polymerized fibrin']
Thb: ['thrombin', 'factor IIa', 'coagulase']

Reason: FM is likely "fibrin monomer" due to its involvement in fibrin polymerization, C1 is probably "fibrinogen" as it is a precursor to FM, C2 seems to be "fibrin polymer" as it is formed from FM and C1, and Thb is likely "thrombin" given its role in wound healing and coagulation.
