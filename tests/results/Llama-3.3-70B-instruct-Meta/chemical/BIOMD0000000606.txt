Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding display names and reactions in the model, and then standardized names or common synonyms were found based on the biochemical context, with glycerol_i, glucose_i, and other intracellular species being matched to their respective biochemical names, and extracellular species (denoted by _e) being matched to the same biochemical names as their intracellular counterparts.
