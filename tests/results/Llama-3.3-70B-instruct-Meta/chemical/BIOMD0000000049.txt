Synonyms:
Rap1_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
B_Raf_Rap1_GTP: ['Rap1 GTP', 'GTP-bound Rap1', 'Rap1-GTP']
Ras_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
B_Raf_Rap1_GTP_MEK: ['UNK']
B_Raf_Rap1_GTP_pMEK: ['UNK']
B_Raf_Rap1_GTP_MEK_ERK: ['UNK']
B_Raf_Rap1_GTP_pMEK_ERK: ['UNK']

Reason: The species Rap1_GDP and Ras_GDP are likely guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to the Rap1 and Ras proteins, respectively. B_Raf_Rap1_GTP is likely the GTP-bound form of the Rap1 protein in complex with B-Raf. The other species are unknown (UNK) because they appear to represent protein complexes or phosphorylated forms that are not directly related to a specific chemical entity, and their display names are empty in the provided model.
