Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
S1: ['UNK']
Pi_: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'orthophosphate']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]

Reason: ATP and ADP are identified as adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate respectively due to their common usage in biochemical contexts, particularly in energy transfer reactions. Pi_ is likely referring to inorganic phosphate, a common product of ATP dephosphorylation. S1 is unknown as it appears to be a state of myosin V in the model rather than a chemical entity with a standardized name.
