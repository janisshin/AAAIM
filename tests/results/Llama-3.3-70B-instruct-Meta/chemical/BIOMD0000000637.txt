Synonyms:
Gt: ['G protein alpha subunit', 'Galpha', 'Gα']
Gd: ['GDP-bound G protein alpha subunit', 'inactive G protein', 'Gα-GDP']
LRGt: ['ligand-bound GPCR', 'activated G protein-coupled receptor', 'GPCR-ligand complex']
RGd: ['RGS protein', 'regulator of G protein signaling', 'RGS']
RGt: ['active RGS protein', 'RGS-Gα complex', 'RGS-G protein complex']
LRGd: ['inactive GPCR', 'unoccupied G protein-coupled receptor', 'GPCR']

Reason: The model is a simplified carrousel model of GPCR signaling, and the species names are annotated based on their roles in the model reactions and the context of GPCR signaling. Gt and Gd are likely to be the active and inactive forms of the G protein alpha subunit, respectively. LRGt and LRGd are likely to be the ligand-bound and unoccupied forms of the GPCR, respectively. RGt and RGd are likely to be the active and inactive forms of the RGS protein, respectively.
