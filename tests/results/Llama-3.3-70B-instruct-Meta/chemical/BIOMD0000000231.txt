Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate", 'AMP']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate", 'ADP']
NADH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NADH']

Reason: The model is a kinetic study of a ternary cycle between adenine nucleotides, and the display names match the common names for these nucleotides, making the standardized names highly likely. NADH is also a well-known coenzyme, and its presence in the model suggests it is being used as a common synonym.
