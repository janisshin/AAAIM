Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose 1,5-biphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'PGA']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'O2']

Reason: The model is of the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is a photosynthetic process, and the reactions provided match known reactions in this cycle. RuBP is a known substrate in the RuBisCO reaction, PGA is a product of this reaction, NADPH is a reducing agent, CO2 is a reactant in the Calvin cycle, and O2 is a byproduct of photosynthesis. The display names provided also match common names for these species.
