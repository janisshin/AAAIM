Synonyms:
species_1: ['glycine', 'glycin', 'aminoacetic acid']
species_13: ['glycine', 'glycin', 'aminoacetic acid']

Reason: The display names 'Glyin' and 'Glyex' are likely abbreviations for glycine, a non-essential amino acid, given the context of the yeast HOG pathway model and the lack of other information suggesting alternative chemical entities.
