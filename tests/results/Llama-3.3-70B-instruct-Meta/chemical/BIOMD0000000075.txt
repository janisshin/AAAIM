Synonyms:
PIP2_PHGFP_PM: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PIP2', '1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate']
IP3_PHGFP_Cyt: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
PIP2_PM: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PIP2', '1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate']
DAG_PM: ['1,2-diacylglycerol', 'DAG', 'diglyceride']
IP3X_Cytosol: ['UNK']
IP3_Cyt: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']

Reason: PIP2_PHGFP_PM, PIP2_PM, IP3_PHGFP_Cyt, and IP3_Cyt can be identified based on their display names and the context of the phosphoinositide turnover model, which involves the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG_PM is likely 1,2-diacylglycerol, a product of PIP2 hydrolysis. IP3X_Cytosol could not be identified due to the lack of information about the "X" suffix, making it uncertain.
