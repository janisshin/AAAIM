Synonyms:
s1: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
s2: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
s3: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
s4: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
s6: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']

Reason: s1, s2, s3, and s4 are all related to calcium (Ca) based on their display names, so they are likely to be calcium ions. s6 is explicitly named as IP3, which is a common synonym for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
