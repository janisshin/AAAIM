Synonyms:
species_3: ['threonine', 'tyrosine', 'thymidine']
species_5: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine-5'-triphosphate"]
species_6: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine-5'-diphosphate"]
species_7: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'orthophosphate']
species_8: ['GAP', 'GTPase-activating protein', 'GTPase activating protein']
species_10: ['active GTP-bound state', 'GTP-bound Ras', 'Ras-GTP']
species_11: ['GTP-bound state', 'active GTP', "Guanosine-5'-triphosphate"]
species_12: ['GDP-bound state', 'inactive GDP', "Guanosine-5'-diphosphate"]
species_13: ['RGD motif', 'arginine-glycine-aspartate', 'cell attachment sequence']
species_15: ['active GTP-bound Ras', 'Ras-GTP complex', 'GTP-bound Ras protein']
species_16: ['RGAD', 'arginine-glycine-aspartic acid', 'UNK']

Reason: The model is a GTPase cycle, where species_5 and species_6 are likely GTP and GDP, respectively, due to their display names. Species_7 is phosphate, a common byproduct of GTP hydrolysis. Species_8 is GAP, a GTPase-activating protein. Species_10, species_11, and species_15 are related to the active GTP-bound state, while species_12 is the inactive GDP-bound state. Species_13 is the RGD motif, a cell attachment sequence. Species_3 is unclear, but may be a amino acid. Species_16 is unclear and may not be a chemical entity, hence "UNK" is also provided.
