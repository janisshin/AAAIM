Synonyms:
c: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
cer: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
cAMP: ['cyclic AMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate", 'cAMP']

Reason: c and cer are annotated as calcium concentrations, so they are likely referring to calcium ions. cAMP is a well-known molecule with a standardized name, and its display name matches this.
