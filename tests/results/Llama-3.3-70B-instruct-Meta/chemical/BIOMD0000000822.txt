Synonyms:
Cytosolic_Rapamycin: ['sirolimus', 'rapamycin', 'AY-22989']
mTOR_Rapamycin: ['UNK']
mTORC1_Rapamycin: ['UNK']

Reason: Cytosolic_Rapamycin is likely to be the chemical entity "rapamycin" or its synonyms, as it is formed from the absorption of rapamycin and has a display name "Cytosolic Rapamycin". mTOR_Rapamycin and mTORC1_Rapamycin are not chemical entities, but rather complexes or proteins bound to rapamycin, so they are annotated as "UNK".
