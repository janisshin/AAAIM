Synonyms:
species_1: ['dietary cholesterol', 'cholesterol', 'dietary cholesteryl esters']
species_2: ['intestinal cholesterol', 'cholesterol', 'unesterified cholesterol']
species_7: ['HDL cholesterol', 'high-density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'HDL-C']
species_8: ['esterified cholesterol', 'cholesterol esters', 'EC']
species_11: ['phosphatidylcholine', 'PC', 'phospholipid']
species_13: ['HCE', 'cholesterol esters', 'hydrolyzed cholesterol esters']
species_14: ['ACAT', 'acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase', 'acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase']
species_28: ['phosphatidylethanolamine', 'PE', 'phospholipid']

Reason: The annotations are based on the display names and the context of the model, which is focused on cholesterol metabolism. species_1 is likely dietary cholesterol, as it is the starting point for the model. species_2 is intestinal cholesterol, which is converted from dietary cholesterol. species_7 is HDL cholesterol, a type of lipoprotein. species_8 is esterified cholesterol, which is formed from intestinal cholesterol. species_11 is phosphatidylcholine, a type of phospholipid. species_13 is likely hydrolyzed cholesterol esters, which is formed from HDL cholesterol. species_14 is ACAT, an enzyme involved in cholesterol esterification. species_28 is phosphatidylethanolamine, another type of phospholipid. The annotations for species_2, species_8, and species_13 are less certain due to the lack of explicit information in the model.
