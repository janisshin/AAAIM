Synonyms:
X: ['UNK']
P: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I', 'hydrogen peroxide (oxidized)']
Q: ['UNK']

Reason: P is likely to be hydrogen peroxide because the model is described as the kinetics of the enzyme-substrate compound of peroxidase, and hydrogen peroxide is a common substrate for peroxidase enzymes. The reaction r2: P => E + Q also suggests that P is being broken down into other components, consistent with the behavior of hydrogen peroxide in peroxidase reactions. X and Q are unknown because there is no clear information about their chemical identity in the provided text.
