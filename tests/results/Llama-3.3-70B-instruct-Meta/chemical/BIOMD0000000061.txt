Reason: The standardized names and common synonyms were determined based on the display names provided in the model and common biochemical knowledge. For species with display names that directly correspond to well-known biochemical compounds (e.g., ATP, NAD, glucose), the standardized names were straightforward. For species with less common or more specific names (e.g., FBP, BPG, PEP), the standardized names were determined based on common usage in biochemistry. Species with unclear or ambiguous display names (e.g., EtOH, ACA) were assigned standardized names based on the most likely interpretation. Species with "exogenous" or "extracellular" designations (e.g., GlcX, GlycX, ACAX) were assigned standardized names that reflect their extracellular origin.
