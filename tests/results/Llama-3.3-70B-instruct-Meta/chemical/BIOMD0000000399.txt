Reason: Most species (x20, x21, x27, x29, x36, x37, x42, x67, x68, x70, x89, x90, x93, x94) are annotated as "UNK" because their names appear to be complex protein or signaling pathway components, which are not directly related to chemical entities that can be looked up in ChEBI. In contrast, species x26, x28, x43, x69, and x71 are annotated with standardized names for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP) because their display names contain the strings "Ras-GDP" or "Ras-GTP", which suggest a relationship to these chemical entities.
