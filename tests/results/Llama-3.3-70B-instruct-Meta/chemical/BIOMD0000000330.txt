Synonyms:
Ca_cyt: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_ER: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_mit: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: All three species are likely to represent calcium ions in different cellular compartments (cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria), as indicated by their names and the context of the model, which is focused on calcium signaling.
