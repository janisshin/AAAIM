Synonyms:
c2: ['ErbB1', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'EGFR']
c3: ['EGF:ErbB1:ATP', 'epidermal growth factor:EGFR:ATP', 'EGF:EGFR complex']
c500: ['UNK']
c4: ['EGF:ErbB1:ATP', 'epidermal growth factor:EGFR:ATP', 'EGF:EGFR complex']
c10: ['EGF:ErbB1:ATP', 'epidermal growth factor:EGFR:ATP', 'EGF:EGFR complex']
c11: ['EGF:ErbB1:ATP', 'epidermal growth factor:EGFR:ATP', 'EGF:EGFR complex']
c106: ['phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate', 'PIP3', 'inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
c285: ['inhibitor', 'Inh', 'UNK']
c462: ['phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate:Shp', 'PIP3:Shp', 'UNK']

Reason: c2, c3, c4, c10, and c11 are related to the ErbB1 receptor and EGF, so their standardized names are related to these proteins. c106 is identified as PIP3, a well-known molecule in signaling pathways. c285 is an inhibitor, but its exact identity is unknown. c462 is a complex of PIP3 and Shp, but its exact identity is also unknown. c500 is unknown due to the lack of information about its reactants or products.
