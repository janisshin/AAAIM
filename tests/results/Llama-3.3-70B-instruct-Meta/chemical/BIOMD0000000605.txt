Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding display names and reactions in the model, and then standardized names or common synonyms were found based on the biochemical context, with glycerol_i, glucose_i, and other intracellular species matched to their common biochemical names, and extracellular species (glycerol_e, glucose_e, etc.) matched to the same names as their intracellular counterparts, as they represent the same chemical entities in different compartments.
