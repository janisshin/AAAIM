Synonyms:
FeDuo: ['iron', 'ferric ion', 'non-transferrin bound iron']
FeRBC: ['iron', 'heme iron', 'hemoglobin iron']
FeSpleen: ['iron', 'spleen iron', 'hemosiderin iron']
FeLiver: ['iron', 'liver iron', 'ferritin iron']
Fe2Tf: ['diferric transferrin', 'holotransferrin', 'iron-transferrin complex']
Fe1Tf: ['monoferric transferrin', 'transferrin', 'apotransferrin']
NTBI: ['non-transferrin bound iron', 'labile plasma iron', 'free iron']
FeRest: ['iron', 'tissue iron', 'storage iron']
FeOutside: ['iron', 'excreted iron', 'lost iron']
FeBM: ['iron', 'bone marrow iron', 'erythroid iron']

Reason: The annotations are based on the model's context, which describes iron distribution in mice. FeDuo, FeRBC, FeSpleen, FeLiver, FeRest, and FeBM are likely to represent iron in different tissues or cells, while Fe2Tf and Fe1Tf represent transferrin-bound iron. NTBI represents non-transferrin bound iron, and FeOutside represents iron that is excreted or lost. The reactions and display names provide clues about the species' roles and relationships, allowing for informed annotations.
