Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding standardized names or common synonyms based on their display names and the reactions they participate in within the model. The model's context, which combines glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, helped to disambiguate species with multiple possible names. For example, "G6P" was matched to "glucose 6-phosphate" due to its role in glycolysis, while "T6P" was matched to "trehalose 6-phosphate" based on its involvement in trehalose metabolism. Species without clear display names or reaction roles, such as "UDG", were matched to their most likely standardized names based on their abbreviations and the model's context.
