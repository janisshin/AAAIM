Reason: The standardized names and common synonyms for each species were determined based on their display names and roles in the purine metabolism model. The most likely names were chosen based on their frequency of use in biochemical literature and their relevance to the model. For species like HX and Xa, multiple possible names were considered due to their potential to represent different compounds in the model, but the most likely names were chosen based on their display names and the context of the model.
