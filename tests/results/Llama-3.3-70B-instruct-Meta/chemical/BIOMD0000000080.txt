Synonyms:
DRG_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
G_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
DRG_GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
G_GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: The species names suggest a relation to guanosine nucleotides, and the reactions indicate a cycle between GDP and GTP forms, which is consistent with G-protein signaling. The prefixes "DRG" and "G" likely indicate protein or complex binding, but do not affect the underlying chemical identity.
