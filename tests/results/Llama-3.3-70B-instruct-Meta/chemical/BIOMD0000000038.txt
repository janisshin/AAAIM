Synonyms:
PyrPI: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
EIICBPGlc: ['UNK']
PEP: ['phosphoenolpyruvate', 'phosphoenolpyruvic acid', '2-phosphoenolpyruvate']
Pyr: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
GlcP: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'D-glucose-6-phosphate', 'glucose 6-phosphate']
Glc: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']

Reason: PyrPI and Pyr are likely pyruvate due to the model context, PEP is a common intermediate in glycolysis, GlcP is likely glucose-6-phosphate due to its role in phosphotransferase systems, Glc is likely glucose as it is a common substrate, EIICBPGlc has no clear display name or reaction information to determine its identity.
