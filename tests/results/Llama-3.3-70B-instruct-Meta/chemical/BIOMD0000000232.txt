Reason: The species were annotated based on their display names and roles in the TCA cycle and ATP production model. He was annotated as "UNK" because its display name "H+" is already assigned to species H, and its reaction vleak: $He => $H suggests it might be an error or a duplicate, rather than a distinct chemical entity.
