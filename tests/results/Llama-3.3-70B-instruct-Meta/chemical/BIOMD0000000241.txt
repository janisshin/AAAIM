Synonyms:
X_gut: ['caffeine', 'caffeine, dietary', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine']
C_p: ['caffeine', 'caffeine, plasma', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine']
C_per: ['caffeine, peripheral', 'caffeine, peripheral compartment', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine']
C_e: ['caffeine, effect', 'caffeine, effective', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine']
C_t: ['caffeine, tolerance', 'caffeine, tolerant', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine']

Reason: The model is a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of caffeine, and the species names are likely related to different compartments or effects of caffeine in the body. X_gut is likely caffeine in the gut, C_p is caffeine in the plasma, C_per is caffeine in the peripheral compartment, C_e is the effective concentration of caffeine, and C_t is the concentration of caffeine related to tolerance.
