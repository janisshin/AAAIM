Synonyms:
L: ['ligand', 'signaling molecule', 'signaling ligand']
C: ['ligand-receptor complex', 'receptor-ligand complex', 'signal complex']
X: ['transcription factor complex', 'inactive transcription factor complex', 'protein complex']

Reason: L is likely a signaling molecule or ligand based on the model description and notes. C is a ligand-receptor complex as defined in the nomenclature. X is a complex of the ligand-receptor complex bound to an inactive transcription factor, hence the suggested names.
