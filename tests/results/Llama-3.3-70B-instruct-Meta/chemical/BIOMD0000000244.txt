PEP: ['phosphoenolpyruvic acid', 'phosphoenolpyruvate', 'PEP']
PG3: ['3-phosphoglyceric acid', '3-phosphoglycerate', 'PGA']
PYR: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
CraFBP: ['UNK']
CrpcAMP: ['UNK']
PdhRPYR: ['UNK']

Reason: The species are annotated based on their display names and the reactions they participate in. For example, ACoA is identified as "acetyl-CoA" because it is involved in reactions that are typical of acetyl-CoA metabolism, such as the conversion to citrate. Species without clear display names or reaction information, such as CraFBP, CrpcAMP, and PdhRPYR, are annotated as "UNK" due to lack of information.
