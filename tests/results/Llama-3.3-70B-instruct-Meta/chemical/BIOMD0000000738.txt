Synonyms:
FeDuo: ['iron', 'ferric ion', 'non-transferrin bound iron']
FeRBC: ['iron', 'heme iron', 'hemoglobin iron']
FeSpleen: ['iron', 'spleen iron', 'ferric ion']
FeLiver: ['iron', 'liver iron', 'ferritin']
Fe2Tf: ['transferrin', 'diferric transferrin', 'holotransferrin']
Fe1Tf: ['monoferric transferrin', 'transferrin', 'apotransferrin']
NTBI: ['non-transferrin bound iron', 'labile plasma iron', 'free iron']
FeRest: ['iron', 'tissue iron', 'ferric ion']
FeOutside: ['iron', 'excreted iron', 'lost iron']
FeBM: ['iron', 'bone marrow iron', 'erythroid iron']

Reason: The annotations are based on the model's context, which describes iron distribution in mice. FeDuo, FeRBC, FeSpleen, FeLiver, FeRest, and FeBM are likely to represent iron in different tissues or cells, while Fe2Tf and Fe1Tf represent transferrin with two or one iron ions bound, respectively. NTBI represents non-transferrin bound iron, which is a common term in iron metabolism. FeOutside likely represents iron that is excreted or lost from the system.
