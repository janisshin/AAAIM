Synonyms:
Methionine: ['methionine', 'L-methionine', 'L-methionine(z)']
AdoMet: ['S-adenosylmethionine', 'SAM', 'S-adenosyl-L-methionine']
Homocysteine: ['homocysteine', 'L-homocysteine', 'L-homocysteine(z)']
Cystathionine: ['cystathionine', 'L-cystathionine', 'L-cystathionine(z)']

Reason: The model is described as the "Methionine Cycle" and the species are directly mentioned in the display names and reactions, allowing for straightforward identification of their standardized names. Methionine, AdoMet (S-adenosylmethionine), Homocysteine, and Cystathionine are all key components in the methionine cycle, a metabolic pathway involved in methionine metabolism, which supports their identification with high likelihood.
