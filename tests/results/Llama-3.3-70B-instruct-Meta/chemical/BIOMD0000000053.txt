Synonyms:
Glucose: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Lysine: ['lysine', 'L-lysine', 'amino acid L-lysine']
Glyoxal: ['glyoxal', 'ethanedial', 'oxalaldehyde']

Reason: Glucose and Lysine are well-known biochemical compounds with standard names, while Glyoxal is a common chemical name; the reactions and model context support these annotations, with Glucose and Lysine being a sugar and amino acid, respectively, and Glyoxal being a likely intermediate in the formation of advanced glycosylation end-products like CML.
