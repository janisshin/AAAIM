Synonyms:
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', '3-phosphoglyceraldehyde', 'G3P']
PYR: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
NADHm: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (mitochondrial)', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (mitochondrial)']
NADHc: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (cytosolic)', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (cytosolic)']
Cam: ['UNK']

Reason: G3P, PYR, and ATP are identified based on their roles in glycolysis and energy metabolism. NADHm and NADHc are identified as mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of NADH, respectively. Cam is unknown as its display name and reactions do not provide sufficient information to determine its chemical identity.
