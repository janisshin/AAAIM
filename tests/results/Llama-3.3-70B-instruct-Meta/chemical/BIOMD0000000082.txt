Synonyms:
DRG_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
DRG_GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
G_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
G_GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: The species names suggest a relation to guanosine nucleotides, and the reactions imply a G-protein cycle, where GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, which is consistent with the expected behavior of G-proteins in signal transduction pathways, including adenylate cyclase inhibition. The prefixes "DRG_" and "G_" likely refer to specific states or conformations of the G-protein, but do not affect the underlying chemical identity.
