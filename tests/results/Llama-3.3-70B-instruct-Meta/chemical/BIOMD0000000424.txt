Synonyms:
RasGDP: ['guanosine diphosphate ras', 'ras-gdp', 'ras-guanosine diphosphate']
RasGTP: ['guanosine triphosphate ras', 'ras-gtp', 'ras-guanosine triphosphate']
PI2: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'ptdins(4,5)p2', 'pip2']
PIP3: ['phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate', 'ptdins(3,4,5)p3', 'pip3']
PTEN_PI: ['UNK']
PI3Ka_PI: ['UNK']

Reason: RasGDP and RasGTP are likely referring to the guanosine diphosphate and triphosphate bound forms of the Ras protein, respectively. PI2 and PIP3 are likely referring to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, respectively, which are involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PTEN_PI and PI3Ka_PI are unknown as they appear to be protein complexes or modified forms, but their exact chemical composition is unclear.
