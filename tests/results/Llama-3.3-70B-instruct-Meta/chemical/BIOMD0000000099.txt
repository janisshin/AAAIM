Synonyms:
species_0: ['cAMP', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cyclic AMP']
species_1: ['cAMP', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cyclic AMP']

Reason: Both species_0 and species_1 are annotated as "cAMP" (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) due to their display names "Ex_cAMP" and "In_cAMP", which likely refer to extracellular and intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, respectively.
