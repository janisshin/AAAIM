Synonyms:
Ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
PP2BinactiveCa2: ['UNK']
cAMP: ['cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cAMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"]
cAMP_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP2_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP3_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP4_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP4_R2C: ['UNK']
cAMP4_R2: ['UNK']
cAMP_PDE: ['cAMP-PDE complex', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase complex', 'UNK']
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', 'AMP', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]
cAMP_PDEP: ['cAMP-PDEP complex', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase complex', 'UNK']

Reason: The species Ca is likely calcium due to its involvement in biological processes and the presence of "Ca" in its name. cAMP is likely cyclic adenosine monophosphate due to its common abbreviation. AMP is likely adenosine monophosphate due to its common abbreviation. The other species are unknown (UNK) because they are complexes or modified forms of cAMP, and their exact chemical structures are unclear from the provided information.
