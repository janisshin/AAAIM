Synonyms:
IPTG: ['isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside', 'isopropylthiogalactoside', 'IPTG']
A1: ['N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone', '3-oxo-C6-HSL', '3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone']
A2: ['N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone', '3-oxo-C6-HSL', '3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone']

Reason: IPTG is a known chemical inducer, A1 and A2 are likely autoinducer molecules in the quorum sensing system of E. coli, given the context of the predator-prey ecosystem model and the mention of AHLs (Acyl-Homoserine Lactones) in the article.
