Model: BIOMD0000000043
LLM: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
Timestamp: 2025-06-15 15:37:00

Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']
Z: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']
Y: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']

Reason: The model is described as a "Calcium Oscillation" model, and the reactions involve the conversion of EC to Z, and Y to Z, suggesting that all species are related to calcium. The lack of specific display names for the species and the context of the model suggest that they are all likely to be different forms or concentrations of calcium.
