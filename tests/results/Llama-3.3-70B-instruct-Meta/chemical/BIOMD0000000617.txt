Synonyms:
v: ['gamma-secretase activity', 'amyloid precursor protein cleavage activity', 'gamma-secretase enzyme activity']

Reason: The model is described as "Inhibition kinetics of DAPT on APP Cleavage" and mentions "?-secretase" which is likely a typo for "Î³-secretase", an enzyme involved in APP cleavage. The species 'v' is likely related to the activity of this enzyme.
