Synonyms:
s125: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
s126: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
s142: ['erlotinib', 'erlotinib hydrochloride', 'OSI-774']

Reason: s125 and s126 are likely guanosine diphosphate and guanosine triphosphate, respectively, as they are common molecules involved in cellular signaling pathways, including the EGF Receptor Signaling Pathway. s142 is identified as erlotinib, a known tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in cancer treatment, which is consistent with the context of the EGF Receptor Signaling Pathway.
