Synonyms:
PYRout: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
GLCex: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood glucose']
F16P: ['fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose-1,6-diphosphate', 'F1,6BP']
PYRin: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
LAC: ['lactic acid', 'lactate', '2-hydroxypropanoic acid']
OAA: ['oxaloacetic acid', 'oxaloacetate', '2-oxobutanedioic acid']
G1P: ['glucose-1-phosphate', 'D-glucose-1-phosphate', 'G1P']

Reason: PYRout and PYRin are likely pyruvate due to their involvement in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, F16P is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate due to its role in glycolysis, GLCex is glucose as it is the external glucose, LAC is lactic acid as it is a common byproduct of glycolysis, OAA is oxaloacetic acid as it is an intermediate in gluconeogenesis and the citric acid cycle, and G1P is glucose-1-phosphate as it is an intermediate in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis.
