Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding standardized names or common synonyms based on their display names and reaction equations in the model. For example, GLCi was matched to "glucose" due to its involvement in glycolysis, while F16bP was matched to "fructose-1,6-bisphosphate" based on its reaction with ATP and F6P. Species with unclear or missing display names, such as PYRmito, were matched to their likely corresponding species based on the reaction equations and the context of the model.
