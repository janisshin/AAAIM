Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose 1,5-biphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'phosphoglycerate']
GAP: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'G3P', 'glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate']
Ru5P: ['ribulose-5-phosphate', 'Ru5P', 'ribulose 5-phosphate']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
Pi: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'orthophosphate']

Reason: The model is of the Calvin cycle, a photosynthetic process in plants, and the reactions and display names provided match known biochemical reactions and metabolites in this cycle. RuBP is the substrate for the RuBisCO enzyme, PGA is a product of the RuBisCO reaction, GAP is a product of the GAP_DH reaction, Ru5P is a product of the GAP2Ru5P reaction, ADP and ATP are energy transfer molecules, and Pi is an inorganic phosphate group.
