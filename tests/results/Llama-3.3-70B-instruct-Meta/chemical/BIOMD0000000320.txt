Synonyms:
A_dopa: ['levodopa', 'L-dopa', '3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine']
C_dopa: ['3-O-methyldopa', '3-OMD', '3-methoxytyrosine']

Reason: A_dopa is likely "levodopa" due to the model name and description, which mentions "L-dopa" as a substrate. C_dopa is likely "3-O-methyldopa" because the reaction "COMT_clearance: C_dopa => C_OMD" suggests a relationship between C_dopa and 3-O-methyldopa, which is a known metabolite of levodopa.
