Synonyms:
X_7_MET_MET: ['MET protein', 'hepatocyte growth factor receptor', 'MET proto-oncogene']
X_10_p_MET_MET: ['phosphorylated MET protein', 'p-MET', 'activated MET']

Reason: X_7_MET_MET is likely the MET protein homodimer, and X_10_p_MET_MET is its phosphorylated form, based on the display names and reactions in the model, which describe the dimerization and phosphorylation of MET.
