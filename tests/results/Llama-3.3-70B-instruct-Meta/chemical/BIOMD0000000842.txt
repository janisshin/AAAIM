Synonyms:
PIP2: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PtdIns(4,5)P2', 'inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate precursor']
DAG: ['diacylglycerol', 'diglyceride', '1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol']

Reason: PIP2 and DAG are well-known intermediates in the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway, which is often activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), consistent with the model's context. The reactions provided also match the expected biochemical relationships between these species, with PIP2 being converted to DAG and IP3 (not explicitly mentioned but implied) by PLC, and DAG being a downstream signaling molecule.
