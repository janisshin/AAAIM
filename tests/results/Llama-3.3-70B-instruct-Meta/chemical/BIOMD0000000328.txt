Reason: The model is a simulation of atorvastatin metabolism, and the species names are likely related to atorvastatin and its metabolites. The suffixes "_m", "_c", and "_b" likely refer to different compartments or locations (e.g. mitochondria, cytosol, blood), and the prefixes "AS", "ASpOH", and "ASoOH" likely refer to atorvastatin and its hydroxy metabolites. The reactions and display names provide additional context for the species names.
