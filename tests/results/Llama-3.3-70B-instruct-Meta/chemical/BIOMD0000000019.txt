Synonyms:
x26: ['GDP-bound Ras', 'Ras-GDP', 'Ras protein']
x28: ['GTP-bound Ras', 'Ras-GTP', 'Active Ras']

Reason: The display names 'Ras-GDP' and 'Ras-GTP' directly correspond to the standardized names, indicating the species are related to the Ras protein in different guanine nucleotide-bound states, which is a key component in the MAPK signaling pathway.
