Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate", 'ADP']
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate", 'AMP']

Reason: The species ATP, ADP, and AMP are identified as adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate respectively, which are standardized names for these molecules, commonly involved in energy transfer within cells, and their participation in the reactions described in the model (e.g., E1UbBinding, ProteasomeActivity) aligns with their known biochemical roles.
