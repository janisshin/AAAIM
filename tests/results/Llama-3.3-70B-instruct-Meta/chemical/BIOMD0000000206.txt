Synonyms:
s1: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
at: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
s2: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'F1,6BP', 'fructose 1,6-bisphosphate']
s3: ['dihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'DHAP', 'glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate']
na: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NAD', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(1+)']
s4: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', '1,3-diphosphoglycerate']
s5: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
s6: ['acetaldehyde', 'ethanal', 'acetic aldehyde']
s6o: ['acetaldehyde', 'ethanal', 'acetic aldehyde']

Reason: The model is based on glycolytic oscillations, and the display names provided match common intermediates in the glycolytic pathway, allowing for confident annotation of species to standardized chemical names. s6 and s6o are likely referring to the same chemical entity, with s6o specifying its extracellular location.
