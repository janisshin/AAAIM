Reason: The species names are annotated based on the context of the model, which describes the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide. The names are constructed by combining the components of the reaction, such as "nitric oxide" and "soluble guanylate cyclase". The likelihood of the names is ranked based on the specificity and clarity of the description. "UNK" is used when the description is unclear or incomplete, or when the species is not a specific chemical entity.
