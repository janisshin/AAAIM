Reason: The annotations are based on the display names and reaction equations provided in the model. For species with no display names, the annotations are inferred from the reaction equations and the context of the model. The likelihood of each annotation is ranked based on the specificity and common usage of the names in biochemical contexts. Species like Ac, AcO, and AcP are annotated based on their likely roles in the reactions, while species like AcetoinIn and AcetoinOut are annotated with the same names due to the lack of distinction in the model.
