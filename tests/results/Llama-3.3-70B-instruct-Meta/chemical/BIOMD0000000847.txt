Synonyms:
X_1: ['shikimate', 'shikimic acid', '3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid']
X_2: ['phenylalanine', 'L-phenylalanine', 'alpha-amino-beta-phenylpropanoic acid']
X_3: ['caffeoyl-shikimate', 'caffeic acid', '3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid']
X_4: ['UNK']

Reason: X_1 is likely shikimate due to the reaction "a_0_Shikimate_Biosynthesis" producing it. X_2 is probably phenylalanine because it is consumed by the reaction "V_5_Phenylalanine_To_Protein" and produced from X_1 in "V_1_Phenylalanine_Biosynthesis_Shikimate". X_3 might be caffeoyl-shikimate or a related compound due to its involvement in "V_3_Caffeoyl_Shikimate_Biosynthesis". X_4 is unknown as its reactants and products do not provide clear information about its identity.
