Synonyms:
CaER: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_Cyt: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: CaER and Ca_Cyt are likely referring to calcium ions in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, respectively, based on the context of the model name "Oxhamre2005_Ca_oscillation" and the reaction equations, which suggest calcium ion movement between these compartments.
