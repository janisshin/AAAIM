Synonyms:
Galpha_GTP: ['GTP-bound Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1', 'Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha', 'G-protein alpha subunit']
IP3: ['Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'Inositol trisphosphate']
Ca_ER: ['Calcium ion', 'Calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
Ca_Cyt: ['Calcium ion', 'Calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
DG: ['1,2-Diacylglycerol', 'Diglyceride', 'Diacylglycerol']

Reason: Galpha_GTP is likely a G-protein alpha subunit bound to GTP, IP3 is a well-known second messenger, Ca_ER and Ca_Cyt are both calcium ions but in different locations, and DG is likely diacylglycerol, a common lipid second messenger, based on the context of the model and display names.
