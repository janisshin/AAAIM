Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding chemical names based on common abbreviations and names used in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate bypass. The likelihood of each match was ranked based on the frequency of use and standardization of the names in biochemical literature. Species like "ssa" and "sca" were less likely to be standard species due to their less common usage and potential ambiguity.
