Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding standardized names based on the display names and reaction equations provided in the model. The reactions suggest a glycolytic pathway, where glucose is converted to pyruvate, and then to acetate, ethanol, and other products. The species with "_i" and "_e" suffixes are likely intracellular and extracellular forms of the same compound, respectively. The names were chosen based on common biochemical nomenclature and synonyms.
