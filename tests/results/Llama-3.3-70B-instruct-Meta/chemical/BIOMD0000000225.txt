Synonyms:
GLC: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
G6P_F6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'fructose-6-phosphate', 'G6P']
F6P: ['fructose-6-phosphate', '6-phosphofructose', 'fructose 6-phosphate']
FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBPase substrate']
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', '3-phosphoglyceraldehyde', 'G3P']

Reason: The model is a glycolytic model, and the species names match common intermediates in glycolysis. GLC is likely glucose, the starting material. G6P_F6P is likely an intermediate that can be either glucose-6-phosphate or fructose-6-phosphate, given the reaction vgk. F6P, FBP, and G3P match subsequent intermediates in the glycolytic pathway.
