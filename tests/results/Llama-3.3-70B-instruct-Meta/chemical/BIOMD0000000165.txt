Synonyms:
Gsa_gdp_cell: ['Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit, GDP-bound', 'G protein subunit alpha s, GDP-bound']
Gsa_gtp_cell: ['Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit, GTP-bound', 'G protein subunit alpha s, GTP-bound']
ATP_cell: ["adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
cAMP_cell: ['cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cAMP', 'cyclic AMP']
DMNB_cAMP_cell: ['UNK']

Reason: Gsa_gdp_cell and Gsa_gtp_cell are annotated based on their display names and the context of the G protein signaling pathway. ATP_cell and cAMP_cell are well-known biochemical compounds with standardized names. DMNB_cAMP_cell is unknown due to the lack of information about "DMNB" in the provided context.
