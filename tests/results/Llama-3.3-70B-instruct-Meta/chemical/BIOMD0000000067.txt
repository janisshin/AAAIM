Synonyms:
AcCoA: ['acetyl-CoA', 'acetyl coenzyme A', 'CoA-acetyl']
AcP: ['acetyl phosphate', 'acetylphosphate', 'AcP']
OAc: ['acetate', 'acetic acid', 'acetate ion']
HOAc: ['acetic acid', 'ethanoic acid', 'protonated acetate']
HOAc_E: ['UNK']

Reason: AcCoA, AcP, OAc, and HOAc are identified based on their display names and reaction involvement, which match known biochemical compounds. HOAc_E is marked as "UNK" because it represents "acetate export", which is a process or a location rather than a specific chemical entity.
