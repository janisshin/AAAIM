Synonyms:
ATIII_Heparin: ['antithrombin III', 'antithrombin', 'heparin-antithrombin complex']
Xa_ATIII_Heparin: ['Xa-antithrombin III complex', 'factor Xa-antithrombin complex', 'Xa-inhibitor complex']
C_warf: ['UNK']
IIa_ATIII_Heparin: ['thrombin-antithrombin complex', 'IIa-antithrombin III complex', 'thrombin-inhibitor complex']
A_warf: ['UNK']
IXa_ATIII_Heparin: ['factor IXa-antithrombin complex', 'IXa-antithrombin III complex', 'IXa-inhibitor complex']

Reason: The species names are annotated based on the display names and reactions provided in the model. ATIII_Heparin is likely antithrombin III due to its reaction with various coagulation factors. Xa_ATIII_Heparin, IIa_ATIII_Heparin, and IXa_ATIII_Heparin are likely complexes of antithrombin III with factors Xa, IIa, and IXa, respectively. C_warf and A_warf are unknown as they do not have clear display names or reactions that can be linked to known biochemical entities.
