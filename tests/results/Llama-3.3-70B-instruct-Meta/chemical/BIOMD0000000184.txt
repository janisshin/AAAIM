Synonyms:
X: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Y: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Z: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']

Reason: X and Y are likely calcium ions due to their display names and reaction involvement, with the difference likely being their location (cytoplasmic vs ER) rather than chemical identity. Z is identified as IP3 based on its display name, a common molecule involved in calcium signaling pathways.
