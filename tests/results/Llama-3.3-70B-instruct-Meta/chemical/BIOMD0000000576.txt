Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding display names and reactions in the model, and then standardized names or common synonyms were found based on the context of the nuclear receptor-mediated cortisol signalling network. The model describes the interaction of cortisol with its two nuclear receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor and the pregnane X-receptor, and the species names were matched accordingly. For example, s114 was matched to "cortisol" based on its display name "Cort" and its reaction with s87, which is the glucocorticoid receptor protein. Similarly, DEX was matched to "dexamethasone" based on its display name and its reactions with GRprot_DEX and PXRprot_DEX. The species with no clear display names or reactions, such as s165, were matched to more general terms based on the context of the model.
