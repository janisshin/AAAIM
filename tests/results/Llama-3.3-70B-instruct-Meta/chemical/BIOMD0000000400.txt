Synonyms:
Gd: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
Gt: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
Rg: ['receptor', 'G protein-coupled receptor', 'GPCR']
Rlg: ['ligand', 'agonist', 'endothelin-1']
Rlgp: ['ligand-receptor complex', 'agonist-receptor complex', 'endothelin-1-receptor complex']
Pc: ['IP3', 'inositol trisphosphate', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
Pcg: ['IP3 receptor', 'inositol trisphosphate receptor', 'IP3R']
Pg: ['G alpha subunit', 'GÎ± subunit', 'guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha']
Ca: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium(2+)']

Reason: The model is related to the IP3 signal production system in cardiac myocytes, and the species names are inferred based on the context of the model and the reactions. Gd and Gt are likely GDP and GTP, respectively, due to their involvement in G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Rg is likely a receptor, and Rlg is likely a ligand, such as endothelin-1. Pc is likely IP3, and Pcg is likely the IP3 receptor. Pg is likely the G alpha subunit, and Ca is likely the calcium ion.
