Reason: The model is a GPCR-RGS model, and the species names are based on the components of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. The standardized names are based on the common terminology used in the field of molecular biology and biochemistry. The likelihood of each name is ranked based on the context of the model and the display names provided.
