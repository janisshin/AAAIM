Reason: The species names were matched to their display names and then standardized to common chemical names or synonyms. For species "Nb", no clear match was found, so it was labeled as "UNK". The model context, "Bakker2001_Glycolysis", suggests a glycolytic pathway, which helped in resolving some of the names.
