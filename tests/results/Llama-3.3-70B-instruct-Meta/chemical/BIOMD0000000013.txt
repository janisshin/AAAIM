Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding biochemical names based on the context of the Calvin cycle model, where each species plays a specific role in the metabolic pathway. The names were standardized to their most commonly used forms in biochemistry. x_CO2 is carbon dioxide, ATP_ch is adenosine triphosphate, and x_NADPH_ch is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. The other species were similarly identified based on their roles in the Calvin cycle reactions. x_Pi_cyt, x_GAP_cyt, and x_DHAP_cyt were identified as inorganic phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, respectively, based on their participation in transport reactions across the chloroplast membrane. x_Proton_ch was identified as a hydrogen ion or proton, which is often involved in biochemical reactions. x_NADP_ch was identified as oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which is the oxidized form of NADPH.
