Synonyms:
Ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: The species 'Ca' is likely referring to calcium, a common ion in biological systems, particularly in the context of neuronal bursting and calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The model name "Golomb2006_SomaticBursting_nonzero[Ca]" and the reaction "=> Ca" suggest that 'Ca' is being produced or is involved in the model, consistent with the role of calcium in cellular processes.
