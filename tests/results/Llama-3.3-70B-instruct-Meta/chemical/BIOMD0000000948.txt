Synonyms:
AR_A1: ['alkylresorcinol', 'resorcinol', '4-butylresorcinol']
AR_A2: ['alkylresorcinol', 'resorcinol', '4-butylresorcinol']
AR_Central: ['alkylresorcinol', 'resorcinol', '4-butylresorcinol']
AR_Dose: ['UNK']

Reason: All species except AR_Dose are annotated as "AR" which likely stands for alkylresorcinol, a common chemical entity. AR_Dose is unknown as it is not directly related to a specific chemical entity, but rather seems to represent a dose of alkylresorcinol.
