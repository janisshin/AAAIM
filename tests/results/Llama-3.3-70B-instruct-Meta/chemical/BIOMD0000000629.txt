Synonyms:
L: ['retinoic acid', 'all-trans-retinoic acid', 'ATRA']
LR: ['retinoic acid receptor', 'RAR', 'nuclear receptor']
CA: ['coactivator protein', 'transcriptional coactivator', 'nuclear coactivator']
LRCA: ['UNK']

Reason: L is likely retinoic acid or its analogues based on the model description and the mention of ATRA. LR is probably the retinoic acid receptor, given the context of the model and the article. CA is a coactivator protein, as mentioned in the display names and the article. LRCA is unknown because it is a complex of LR and CA, and its chemical structure or identity is not explicitly mentioned.
