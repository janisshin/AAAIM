Synonyms:
GLC: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood glucose']
G6P_F6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'fructose-6-phosphate', 'UNK']
F6P: ['fructose-6-phosphate', 'fructose 6-phosphate', '6-phosphofructose']
FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose-1,6-diphosphate']
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', '3-phosphoglyceraldehyde']
DHAP: ['dihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'dihydroxyacetonephosphate', 'DHAP']
DHAP_G3P: ['dihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'UNK']

Reason: The model is a glycolytic model, and the species names match common intermediates in glycolysis. GLC is likely glucose, G6P_F6P is unclear but may be related to glucose-6-phosphate or fructose-6-phosphate, F6P is clearly fructose-6-phosphate, FBP is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, G3P is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, DHAP is dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and DHAP_G3P is a pool of DHAP and G3P, but the exact nature is unclear.
