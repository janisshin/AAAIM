Synonyms:
Gd: ['GDP-bound G-alpha', 'G-alpha-GDP', 'Guanosine diphosphate-bound G-alpha']
Ga: ['GTP-bound G-alpha', 'G-alpha-GTP', 'Guanosine triphosphate-bound G-alpha']

Reason: Gd and Ga are annotated based on their display names and the context of the G protein cycle model, where Gd represents the GDP-bound state and Ga represents the GTP-bound state of the G-alpha subunit.
