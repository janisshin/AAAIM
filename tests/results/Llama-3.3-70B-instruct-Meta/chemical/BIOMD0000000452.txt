Reason: The species are annotated based on their display names and reaction equations. mw8f5a7b5c_ca4c_4a4c_85b1_e5d640c426bf and mwa54a9c38_c98b_45e5_8432_4119fb777e44 are likely to be GDP and GTP, respectively, as they are involved in reactions with Ras-GTP-Ras-GAP and Raf1-Ras-GTP. mw83de7813_4941_45a6_a320_a551165bf22a is likely to be Raf1, as it is involved in a reaction with Raf1active. The other species do not have sufficient information to determine their standardized names, so they are annotated as "UNK".
