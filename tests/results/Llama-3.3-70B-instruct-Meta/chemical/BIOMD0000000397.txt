Synonyms:
s32: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
s33: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
s304: ["6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime", "6-bromo-3'-oxoindirubin", 'BIO']

Reason: s32 and s33 are directly annotated with display names 'ATP' and 'ADP' respectively, which are standard names for these molecules. s304 is annotated with a display name that matches a known chemical compound, 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime, which is a GSK-3 inhibitor used in the Wnt signaling pathway.
