Synonyms:
Ca_Cyt: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
IP3_Cyt: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
Ca_ER: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: Ca_Cyt and Ca_ER are likely referring to calcium ions in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, based on the reaction names and the model context. IP3_Cyt is likely referring to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a common second messenger, based on the reaction involving PLC, which is often associated with IP3 production.
