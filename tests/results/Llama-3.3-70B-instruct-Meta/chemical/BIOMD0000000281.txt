Reason: The model is a glycolysis and respiration model, and most of the species can be identified based on their display names and roles in the reactions. ENG, ETG, MOD, MOB, and PPP are less clear, but based on their reactions, they can be tentatively identified as intermediates or complexes. GPP is unclear due to the lack of information about the specific hexose diphosphate. DIN and DIH are identified as NAD+ and NADH, respectively, based on their roles in the reactions and the display names.
