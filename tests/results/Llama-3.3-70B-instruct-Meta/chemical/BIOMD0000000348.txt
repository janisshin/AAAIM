Synonyms:
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', '3-phosphoglyceraldehyde', 'G3P']
PYR: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
ATP: ["adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
NADHm: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (mitochondrial)', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (mitochondrial)']
NADHc: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (cytosolic)', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (cytosolic)']
Cam: ['UNK']

Reason: G3P, PYR, and ATP are identified based on their roles in glycolysis and energy production, which are central to the model's focus on glucose sensing in pancreatic beta cells. NADHm and NADHc are identified as mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of NADH, respectively, due to their involvement in redox reactions and energy production. Cam is unknown due to lack of context or display name that clearly links it to a specific chemical entity.
