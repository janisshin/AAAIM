Synonyms:
ip3: ['inositol trisphosphate', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
atp: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
y: ['UNK']
ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: ip3 is likely inositol trisphosphate due to its involvement in calcium signaling, atp is a common energy currency in cells, y has no display name or reaction information to determine its identity, and ca is likely calcium due to its role in calcium-cell cycle coupling and intracellular calcium release.
