Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'ribulose 1,5-biphosphate', 'RuBP']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'glycerate 3-phosphate']
Ru5P: ['ribulose-5-phosphate', 'ribulose 5-phosphate', 'Ru-5-P']
Pi: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'orthophosphate']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
Pic: ['UNK']

Reason: The model is based on the Calvin-Benson cycle, and the reactions provided match the known biochemical pathways. RuBP, PGA, Ru5P, Pi, ATP, and ADP are all well-known intermediates in the cycle. Pic is not defined in the display names or reactions, so it is unknown.
