Reason: The species names were matched to gibberellin-related compounds and complexes based on the display names and reaction equations provided in the model. The likelihood of each match was ranked based on the specificity of the display name and the reaction equations. Species s1, s23, s24, s25, and s26 were matched to specific gibberellin compounds, while species s65, s29, s30, s31, s32, s62, s36, and s45 were matched to complexes or conjugates of gibberellin compounds with other molecules.
