Synonyms:
CaI: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium(2+)']
IP3: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']
CaO: ['UNK']
CaS: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium(2+)']
CaM: ['calmodulin', 'calcium-modulated protein', 'CaM']

Reason: CaI and CaS are likely calcium ions based on the reaction names and the model context, which involves calcium signaling. IP3 is a well-known molecule involved in calcium signaling. CaO has no clear indication of what it represents, so it's marked as unknown. CaM is likely calmodulin, a protein that binds to calcium ions and plays a role in calcium signaling.
