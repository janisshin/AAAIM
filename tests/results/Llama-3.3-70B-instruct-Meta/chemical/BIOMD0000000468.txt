Reason: s1, s2, s3, and s4 are likely calcium ions due to their display names and reaction involvement. s6 is IP3 based on its display name. s19 is PIP2 based on its display name. s45, s50, s60, s61, and s62 are related to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) due to their display names and reaction involvement. s47 and s48 are calmodulin (CaM) based on their display names. s58 is heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) based on its display name. s64 is nitric oxide (NO) based on its display name. s102 and s103 are Ras proteins based on their display names. s8, s9, s10, s11, s17, s51, s57, s63, s117 are not annotated as they do not have clear display names or reaction involvement that can be linked to a specific chemical entity.
