Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', 'AMP', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]

Reason: The species ATP, ADP, and AMP are likely adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate, respectively, as they are commonly involved in energy transfer reactions in biochemical processes, and their participation in the reactions (e.g., E1UbBinding, ProteasomeActivity1) is consistent with their typical biochemical roles.
