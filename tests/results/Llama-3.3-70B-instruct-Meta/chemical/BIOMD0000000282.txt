Synonyms:
x: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)', 'dihydrogen dioxide']
p: ['catalase-hydrogen peroxide complex', 'enzyme-substrate complex ES', 'catalase-peroxide complex']
p1: ['water', 'H2O', 'oxidized donor']
a: ['electron donor', 'reduced donor', 'NADH']
p2: ['water', 'H2O', 'oxidized donor']

Reason: The species x is identified as hydrogen peroxide from the display name. p is the enzyme-substrate complex, which is likely a catalase-hydrogen peroxide complex. p1 and p2 are products of the reaction, likely water, given the context of catalase action. a is an electron donor, possibly NADH, although the specific donor is not specified in the model.
