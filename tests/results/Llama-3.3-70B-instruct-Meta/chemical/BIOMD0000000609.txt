Synonyms:
Sulphate__PAPS: ["3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate", 'PAPS', 'phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate']
GSH: ['glutathione', 'reduced glutathione', 'GSH']

Reason: Sulphate__PAPS is likely 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, a common biochemical donor of sulfate groups, given its involvement in the reaction with Paracetamol_APAP. GSH is likely glutathione, a well-known antioxidant, given its reaction with NAPQI, a toxic metabolite of acetaminophen.
