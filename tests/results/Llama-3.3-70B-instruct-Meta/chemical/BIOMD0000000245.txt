Synonyms:
s_glu: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
s_pyr: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
s_acetald: ['acetaldehyde', 'ethanal', 'acetic aldehyde']
s_EtOH: ['ethanol', 'ethyl alcohol', 'alcohol']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']
Red: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
S_f: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']

Reason: The species names were matched to their display names and reactions in the model, and then standardized to common chemical names. s_glu, s_pyr, s_acetald, s_EtOH, and CO2 were directly matched to their display names. Red was inferred to be NADH based on its role as a reducing agent in the reactions. S_f was matched to glucose based on its display name "Glucose(feed)".
