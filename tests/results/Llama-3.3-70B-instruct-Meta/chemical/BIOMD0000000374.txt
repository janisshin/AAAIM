Synonyms:
Ca_er_Ca_equations: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']
Ca_i: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']

Reason: Both Ca_er_Ca_equations and Ca_i are likely referring to calcium ions, as the model is related to calcium release-activated current (CRAC) in pancreatic beta-cells and the equations involve calcium flux. The "_er" and "_i" suffixes suggest "endoplasmic reticulum" and "intracellular", respectively, but the underlying chemical entity is still calcium.
