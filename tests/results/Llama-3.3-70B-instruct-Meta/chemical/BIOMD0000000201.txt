Synonyms:
Rasa: ['Ras protein', 'GTPase HRas', 'Ras GTPase']
Rasi: ['Ras protein, inactive', 'GDP-bound Ras', 'inactive HRas']

Reason: Rasa and Rasi are annotated based on their display names as "active Ras" and "inactive Ras", which refers to the Ras protein, a small GTPase involved in cellular signaling pathways. The standardized names are based on common synonyms for the Ras protein in its active and inactive states.
