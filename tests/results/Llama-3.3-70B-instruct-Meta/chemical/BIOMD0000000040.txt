Synonyms:
Br: ['bromide', 'bromide ion', 'Br-']
BrO3: ['bromate', 'bromate ion', 'BrO3-']

Reason: Br is annotated as "Br-" in the display names, which corresponds to bromide ion. BrO3 is annotated as "BrO3-" in the display names, which corresponds to bromate ion. The reactions and model context also support these annotations, as they are consistent with the chemistry of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.
