Reason: The species were matched to their standardized names based on their display names and the context of the model, which is a kinetic model of chloroplastic starch degradation. The display names provided in the model were used to directly match the species to their corresponding standardized names. In cases where the display name was not a direct match, the context of the model and the chemical structure implied by the display name were used to determine the most likely standardized name.
