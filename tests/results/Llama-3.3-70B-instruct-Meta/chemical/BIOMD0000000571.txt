cAMP: ['cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cyclic AMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"]
Pyr: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
PEP: ['phosphoenolpyruvate', 'phosphoenolpyruvic acid', '2-phosphoenolpyruvate']
Glc6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'D-glucose-6-phosphate', 'glucose 6-phosphate']
Glucose: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']

Reason: The CRP_cAMP and its variants are likely related to the cAMP receptor protein, but the specific sites are unknown without more context. cAMP is a well-known molecule, Pyr is likely pyruvate, PEP is phosphoenolpyruvate, Glc6P is glucose-6-phosphate, Glucose is a common sugar, and ATP is adenosine triphosphate. The other species are unknown due to lack of information.
