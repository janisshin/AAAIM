Model: BIOMD0000000044

Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']
Z: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']
A: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'inositol trisphosphate']
Y: ['UNK']

Reason: EC and Z are likely to be calcium ions due to the context of the model being a calcium oscillation model. A is likely to be inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) because the model takes into account the Ca(2+)-activated degradation of IP3. Y is unknown because there is no clear information about its identity in the model or reactions.
