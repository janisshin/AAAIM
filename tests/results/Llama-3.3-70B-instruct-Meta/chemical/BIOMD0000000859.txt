Synonyms:
sucr: ['sucrose', 'table sugar', 'saccharose']
Ephe: ['UNK']
N: ['nitrogen', 'nitrate', 'ammonia']
Next: ['UNK']
Enitrate: ['nitrate', 'nitric acid', 'nitrate ion']
ECO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']

Reason: sucr is likely sucrose due to the reaction names involving sucrose formation and consumption. Ephe and Next are unknown as there is no clear indication of their chemical identity. N is likely related to nitrogen due to the model's focus on nitrate and light/dark conditions. Enitrate is likely nitrate due to its name and the model's context. ECO2 is likely carbon dioxide due to its abbreviation and the model's focus on carbon flux.
