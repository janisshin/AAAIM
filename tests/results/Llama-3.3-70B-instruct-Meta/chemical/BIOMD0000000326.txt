Reason: The species with standardized names are identified based on their display names and reaction equations. Ca2_buff and Ca2_free are likely to be calcium ions, G_GTP and Ga_GTP are likely to be guanosine 5'-triphosphate, and Ga_GDP is likely to be guanosine 5'-diphosphate. cGMP is a well-known molecule with a standardized name. The other species do not have sufficient information to determine their standardized names, so they are labeled as "UNK".
