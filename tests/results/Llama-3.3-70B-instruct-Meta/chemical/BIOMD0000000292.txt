Synonyms:
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
X: ['UNK']
Y: ['UNK']
NADP: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADP+', 'oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']

Reason: NADPH, ADP, ATP, and NADP are well-known biochemical compounds with standardized names. X and Y are unknown because no display names or reactions provide sufficient information to identify them as specific chemical entities.
