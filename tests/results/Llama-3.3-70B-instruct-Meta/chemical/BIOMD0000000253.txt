Synonyms:
HMP: ['hexose monophosphate', 'hexose phosphate', '6-phosphohexose']
Fru16P2: ['fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose-1,6-diphosphate', 'fructose 1,6-biphosphate']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
Glc: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Tre6P: ['trehalose 6-phosphate', 'trehalose phosphate', 'alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]

Reason: The annotations are based on the display names provided in the model and common synonyms used in biochemistry. HMP is annotated as "hexose monophosphate" due to its display name, although it is likely referring to a specific hexose phosphate such as glucose-6-phosphate. Fru16P2 is a well-known intermediate in glycolysis. ATP and ADP are energy currency molecules. Glc is a common substrate for glycolysis. Tre6P is a metabolite involved in trehalose metabolism, but its role in this model is not directly related to glycolysis.
