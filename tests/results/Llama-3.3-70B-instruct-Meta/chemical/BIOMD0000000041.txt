Synonyms:
ADPi: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate']
ATPi: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
Cri: ['creatine']
PCri: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate']
PCr: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate']
ADP: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate']
ATP: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
Cr: ['creatine']
Pi: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate']
P: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate']

Reason: The species can be identified based on their display names and the context of the model, which is related to energy metabolism and creatine kinase. ADPi and ATPi are likely to be ADP and ATP, respectively, with the 'i' suffix possibly indicating a specific compartment or location. Cri and Cr are likely to be creatine, while PCri and PCr are likely to be phosphocreatine. Pi and P are likely to be phosphate or inorganic phosphate.
