Synonyms:
ip3: ['inositol trisphosphate', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
atp: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
y: ['UNK']
ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: ip3 is likely inositol trisphosphate due to its common involvement in calcium signaling pathways, atp is clearly adenosine triphosphate given its role in energy transfer, y has no clear identification and is thus unknown, and ca is likely calcium due to its mention in the model notes and context as being involved in calcium-cell cycle coupling.
