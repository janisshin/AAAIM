Reason: The model is a metabolic model of yeast osmoadaptation, and the species are metabolites involved in glycolysis, glycerol production, and other related pathways. The standardized names are based on common biochemical nomenclature and the context of the model. The suffixes "_i" and "_e" likely indicate intracellular and extracellular compartments, respectively, but do not affect the chemical identity of the species. F16DP is likely fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a key intermediate in glycolysis. G6P is likely glucose-6-phosphate, another intermediate in glycolysis. The other species are identified based on their display names and the reactions they are involved in.
