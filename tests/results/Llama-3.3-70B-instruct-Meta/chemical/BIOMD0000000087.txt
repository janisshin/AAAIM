Synonyms:
RPAssDNA: ['RPA/ssDNA complex', 'replication protein A/single-stranded DNA complex', 'RPA-DNA complex']
RPAssDNA1: ['RPA/ssDNA complex', 'replication protein A/single-stranded DNA complex', 'RPA-DNA complex']
RPAssDNA2: ['RPA/ssDNA complex', 'replication protein A/single-stranded DNA complex', 'RPA-DNA complex']
Mec1RPAssDNA: ['Mec1/RPA/ssDNA complex', 'ATR/replication protein A/single-stranded DNA complex', 'Mec1-RPA-DNA complex']
ATP: ["adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
ADP: ["adenosine 5'-diphosphate", 'ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate']

Reason: The species are annotated based on their display names and reaction equations. RPAssDNA and its variants are likely RPA/ssDNA complexes due to their involvement in RPA binding reactions. Mec1RPAssDNA is likely a complex of Mec1, RPA, and ssDNA. ATP and ADP are standard energy transfer molecules in biochemical reactions.
