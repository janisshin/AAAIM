Synonyms:
NADH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NADH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'molecular oxygen']
H2O2: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'peroxide', 'dihydrogen dioxide']
ArH: ['UNK']
Ar: ['UNK']
NADrad: ['UNK']
super: ['superoxide', 'superoxide anion', 'dioxygenyl']
NAD2: ['NAD+', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
NAD: ['NAD+', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
O2g: ['oxygen gas', 'dioxygen gas', 'molecular oxygen gas']
NADHres: ['reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']

Reason: NADH, O2, H2O2, super, NAD2, NAD, O2g, and NADHres are identified based on their display names and reaction equations, which match known biochemical reactions. ArH and Ar are unknown due to lack of information about their chemical structure or reaction roles. NADrad is unknown as it seems to be a radical form of NAD, but its exact chemical structure is unclear.
