Synonyms:
G1: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T1: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
G2: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T2: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: The model is a glycolytic oscillation model, and the display names 'Glucose_1' and 'Glucose_2' suggest that G1 and G2 are glucose, while 'ATP_1' and 'ATP_2' indicate that T1 and T2 are ATP, with the numbers likely referring to different cellular compartments or phases.
