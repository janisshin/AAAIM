Reason: The model is a glycolysis model in Trypanosoma brucei, and most of the species are intermediates or cofactors in glycolysis. The display names and reactions provide sufficient information to identify the species. For example, DHAP_c and DHAP_g are identified as dihydroxyacetone phosphate based on their display names and involvement in glycolytic reactions. Similarly, ATP_g, ADP_g, and other species are identified based on their display names and roles in energy metabolism. Gly_e is identified as glycine, but its role in the model is unclear. NADH_g is identified as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen, which is a common cofactor in redox reactions.
