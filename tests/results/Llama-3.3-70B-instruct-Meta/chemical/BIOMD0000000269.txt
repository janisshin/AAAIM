Synonyms:
ET: ['ethylene', 'ethene', 'C2H4']
IAA: ['indole-3-acetic acid', 'auxin', 'indoleacetate']
ACC: ['1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid', 'ACC', '1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid']

Reason: ET is likely ethylene, a plant hormone, due to its production and consumption in the model reactions. IAA is likely indole-3-acetic acid, a form of auxin, due to its conversion to Auxin in the reaction v_Auxin. ACC is likely 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, a precursor to ethylene, due to its conversion to ET in the reaction v_Ethylene.
