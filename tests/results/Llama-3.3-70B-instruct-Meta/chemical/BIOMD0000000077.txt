Synonyms:
IP3: ['inositol trisphosphate', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']

Reason: IP3 is likely referring to inositol trisphosphate, a well-known second messenger molecule involved in cellular signaling, including the regulation of calcium release and LH secretion, which is consistent with the model's context of GnRH-induced LH secretion.
