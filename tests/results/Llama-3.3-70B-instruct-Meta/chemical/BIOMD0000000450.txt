Reason: The species were annotated based on their display names and the context of the model, which is a combined model of hepatic polyamine and sulfur amino acid metabolism. The annotations were made by matching the display names to known chemical entities and using common synonyms and standardized names. In some cases, the annotations were made based on the chemical structure or the role of the species in the model. For example, species_8 was annotated as "acetyl-CoA" based on its display name and its role as a precursor to CoA. Similarly, species_9 was annotated as "CoA" based on its display name and its role as a product of acetyl-CoA. The annotations for the polyamine species (e.g. species_2, species_3, species_4) were made based on their display names and their known roles in polyamine metabolism. The annotations for the folate species (e.g. c_thf, m_thf) were made based on their display names and their known roles in one-carbon metabolism. The annotations for the other species were made based on their display names and their known chemical structures or roles in the model.
