Synonyms:
sa93: ['IL18', 'IL-18', 'Interleukin 18']
sa94: ['IL1B', 'IL-1B', 'Interleukin 1 beta']

Reason: sa93 is annotated as 'proIL-18_rna', indicating it is the RNA form of proIL-18, which is a precursor to the cytokine IL-18. sa94 is annotated as 'proIL-1B_rna', indicating it is the RNA form of proIL-1B, which is a precursor to the cytokine IL-1B. The Boolean transitions also support these annotations, as they are regulated by the Nf-KB Complex, which is known to regulate the expression of these cytokines.
