Synonyms:
sa4: ['MAP2K4', 'MKK4', 'JNKK1']
sa5: ['MAP2K7', 'MKK7', 'MEK7']
sa12: ['BCL2', 'BCL2L1', 'BCL2L2']
sa33: ['ATF2', 'CREBP1', 'HB16']
sa34: ['TP53', 'P53', 'TUMOR SUPPRESSOR P53']

Reason: The annotations are based on the display names provided, where sa4 is MAP2K4 phosphorylated, sa5 is MAP2K7 phosphorylated, sa12 is BCL2 phosphorylated, sa33 is ATF2 phosphorylated, and sa34 is TP53 phosphorylated, which directly correspond to the standardized gene names.
