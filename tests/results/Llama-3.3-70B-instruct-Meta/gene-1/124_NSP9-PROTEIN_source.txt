Synonyms:
sa1006: ['EDN1', 'PROEDN', 'PREPROEDN']
sa1189: ['UNK']

Reason: sa1006 is annotated as "EDN1_rna" which corresponds to the Endothelin 1 gene (EDN1), a protein-coding gene. sa1189 is annotated as "RdRpassembled_rna" which does not correspond to a known gene symbol or name, hence it is annotated as "UNK".
