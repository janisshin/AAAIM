Synonyms:
Mdm2_mRNA: ['MDM2', 'HDM2', 'murine double minute 2']
Wip1_mRNA: ['WIP1', 'PPM1D', 'wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1']
PTEN_mRNA: ['PTEN', 'phosphatase and tensin homolog', 'MMAC1']
p21_mRNA: ['CDKN1A', 'p21', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1']
Bax_mRNA: ['BAX', 'Bcl-2-associated X protein', 'apoptosis regulator BAX']

Reason: All are well-characterized gene products involved in p53 pathways; their common names or gene symbols are standard for annotation.
