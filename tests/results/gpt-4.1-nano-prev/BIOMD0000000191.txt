Synonyms:
ARGex: ['arginine', 'L-arginine', 'arginine (free amino acid)']
ORN: ['ornithine', 'L-ornithine', 'ornithine (amino acid)']
ARGin: ['arginine', 'L-arginine', 'arginine (free amino acid)']

Reason: ARGex and ARGin both refer to arginine, with ARGex likely representing extracellular or transported arginine, and ARGin intracellular; ORN is clearly ornithine, a known amino acid involved in arginine metabolism.
