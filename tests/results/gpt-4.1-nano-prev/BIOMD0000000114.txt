Synonyms:
x: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']
y: ['cytoplasmic calcium', 'cytosolic calcium', 'Ca2+ in cytosol']

Reason: x appears to be calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and y is calcium in the cytoplasm, based on the species names and context of calcium oscillations in liver cells.
