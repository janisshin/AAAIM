Synonyms:
X1: ['mRNA of clock gene', 'CLOCK gene mRNA', 'circadian clock gene mRNA']
X2: ['mRNA of clock gene', 'CLOCK gene mRNA', 'circadian clock gene mRNA']

Reason: Both X1 and X2 are labeled as "clock gene mRNA," indicating they are messenger RNAs transcribed from clock genes involved in circadian regulation. They are not proteins or small molecules, so standard mRNA names are appropriate.
