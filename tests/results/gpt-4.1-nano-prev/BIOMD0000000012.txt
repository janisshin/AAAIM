Synonyms:
X: ['LacI mRNA', 'Lac repressor mRNA', 'lacI transcript']
Y: ['TetR mRNA', 'tetracycline repressor mRNA', 'tetR transcript']
Z: ['cI mRNA', 'lambda cI repressor mRNA', 'cl transcript']

Reason: The species are explicitly named as mRNA for LacI, TetR, and cI in the display names, indicating their roles as messenger RNAs for these well-characterized transcriptional repressors.
