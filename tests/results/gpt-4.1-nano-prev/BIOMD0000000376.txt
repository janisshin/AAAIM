Synonyms:
G6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'glucose-6-phosphate']

Reason: G6P is a well-known glycolytic intermediate, commonly named glucose-6-phosphate.

FBP: "fructose-1,6-bisphosphate", "FBP", "fructose-1,6-bisphosphate"
Reason: FBP is a key glycolytic metabolite, known as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.

NADHm: "NADH", "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form", "NADH"
Reason: NADHm refers to the reduced form of NAD+, a common coenzyme in redox reactions.
