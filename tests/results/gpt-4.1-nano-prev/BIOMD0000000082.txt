DR: "dopamine receptor", "dopamine receptor D2", "D2 receptor"
Reason: "DR" commonly refers to dopamine receptor in biochemical contexts.

DRG_GDP: "GDP", "guanosine diphosphate", "guanosine diphosphate (GDP)"
Reason: "DRG_GDP" indicates a GDP-bound form of a G-protein; "GTP" and "GDP" are standard nucleotides.

DRG: "G-protein", "heterotrimeric G protein", "guanine nucleotide-binding protein"
Reason: "DRG" likely refers to a G-protein involved in receptor signaling.

GDP: "guanosine diphosphate", "GDP", "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"
Reason: Standard nucleotide name.

DRG_GTP: "GTP", "guanosine triphosphate", "GTP"
Reason: GTP-bound form of G-protein.

GTP: "guanosine triphosphate", "GTP", "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"
Reason: Standard nucleotide name.
