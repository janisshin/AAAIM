Synonyms:
A: ['activator protein', 'transcription factor', 'gene activator']
C: ['repressor protein', 'transcription repressor', 'gene repressor']
MA: ['mRNA', 'messenger RNA', 'transcript']
MR: ['mRNA', 'messenger RNA', 'transcript']
R: ['repressor', 'repressor molecule', 'repressor protein']

Reason: A and C are proteins involved in gene regulation, with A acting as an activator and C as a repressor. MA and MR are both mRNA transcripts produced by the genes. R is a repressor protein. The model describes a genetic oscillator based on transcription factors, not small molecules.
