Reason: 
Species like Ras2_GDP, Ras2_GDP_Cdc25, Ras2_GTP, Ras2_GTP_Ira2, Ras2_GTP_CYR1, Ras2_GTP_Ira2P are all variants or complexes involving Ras GTPase, which is a well-known signaling protein. GDP and GTP are standard nucleotides. cAMP and derivatives are common second messengers. PKA and phosphodiesterases are well-characterized enzymes. "Ras" and related complexes are standard names for these signaling entities. "UNK" is not appropriate here because all species are identifiable as known signaling molecules or complexes.
