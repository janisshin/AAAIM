Synonyms:
SOCS3mRNA: ['SOCS3 mRNA', 'suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA', 'SOCS3 transcript']
CD274mRNA: ['PD-L1 mRNA', 'CD274 transcript', 'programmed death ligand 1 mRNA']

Reason: Both are mRNA species for cytokine signaling regulators; SOCS3 is a known cytokine signaling inhibitor, CD274 encodes PD-L1, involved in immune regulation.
