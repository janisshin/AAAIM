Synonyms:
MrnaP21: ['p21 mRNA', 'CDKN1A mRNA', 'p21 transcript']
MrnaCy: ['cyclical mRNA', 'cyclin mRNA', 'cell cycle mRNA']
MrnaP53: ['p53 mRNA', 'TP53 mRNA', 'tumor protein p53 transcript']
Dna: ['DNA', 'deoxyribonucleic acid', 'genomic DNA']

Reason: The species are mRNA transcripts and DNA; "MrnaP21" and "MrnaP53" are specific mRNAs for p21 and p53 proteins, respectively. "MrnaCy" likely refers to cyclin mRNA involved in cell cycle regulation. "Dna" is a common abbreviation for DNA.
