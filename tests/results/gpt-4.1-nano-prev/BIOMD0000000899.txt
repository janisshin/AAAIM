Synonyms:
s9: ['UNK']
s16: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP (guanosine triphosphate)']

Reason: s16 is labeled as "EffectorÂ·GTP-Rho," indicating it is a GTP-bound form of Rho, a small GTPase. s9 is simply "Effector" with no specific chemical name provided, so it cannot be confidently annotated.
