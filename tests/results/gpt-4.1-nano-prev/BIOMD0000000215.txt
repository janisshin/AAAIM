Synonyms:
Tbet_mRNA: ['TBX21 mRNA', 'T-bet mRNA', 'T-box transcription factor mRNA']
Ifn_mRNA: ['IFNG mRNA', 'interferon gamma mRNA', 'IFN-Î³ mRNA']
Rec_mRNA: ['unknown', 'UNK', 'not specified']

Reason: Tbet_mRNA and Ifn_mRNA are well-known cytokine and transcription factor mRNAs respectively, which can be mapped to their canonical names. Rec_mRNA is unspecified and not directly linked to a known receptor or gene, so it remains unknown.
