Reason: The species are primarily metabolites involved in central carbon, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, and sterol metabolism, with many being common biochemical compounds. The intracellular/extracellular designation indicates location but does not alter the core identity. "UNK" is used if no clear chemical identity can be assigned.
