Synonyms:
SP1_TIMP1_DNA: ['TIMP1', 'TIMP-1', 'Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1']
TIMP1_DNA: ['TIMP1', 'TIMP-1', 'Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1']

Reason: Both species refer to the gene encoding TIMP-1, a well-known inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, which is a recognized protein name. The DNA notation indicates the gene, but for biochemical context, the protein name is more relevant for ChEBI lookup.
