Synonyms:
HMP: ['hexose monophosphate', 'glucose-6-phosphate', 'glucose 6-phosphate']
Fru16P2: ['fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose 1,6-biphosphate', 'F-1,6-P2']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate']
Glc: ['glucose']
Tre6P: ['trehalose 6-phosphate']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate']

Reason: All are well-established biochemical compounds with standard names; HMP and Fru16P2 are specific intermediates in glycolysis, ATP and ADP are primary energy carriers, Glc is a common abbreviation for glucose, and Tre6P is a known precursor in trehalose biosynthesis.
