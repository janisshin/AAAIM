ECO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'dioxide']
Estarch: ['starch', 'amylose', 'amylopectin']

Reason: 
sucr is sucrose, a common disaccharide.
EtrioseP and trioseP are both likely glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a key metabolite.
Ephe is unclear; no standard name matches, so "UNK".
N is nitrogen, a fundamental element.
starch and Estarch are both starch, a polysaccharide.
Next is unknown, no info.
Enitrate is nitrate ion, common form of nitrogen in oxidized state.
ECO2 is carbon dioxide, a common metabolic product.
