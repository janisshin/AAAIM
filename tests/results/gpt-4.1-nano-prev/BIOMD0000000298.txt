Synonyms:
MP: ['myosin phosphatase', 'protein phosphatase', 'phosphatase enzyme']
MT: ['microtubule', 'tubulin', 'mitotic spindle']

Reason: MP and MT are common abbreviations in cell biology; MP likely refers to myosin phosphatase, and MT to microtubules. Since these are not explicitly defined in the model, the most probable chemical entities are these common biological molecules.
