Synonyms:
s3: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'Ca']

Reason: s3 is labeled as "Ca_c", indicating calcium ion, a common biochemical species.

s45: "endothelial nitric oxide synthase cofactor", "eNOS cofactor", "eNOS-CaM-Ca4"
Reason: s45 is involved in reactions with eNOS and calmodulin, likely representing a calcium-bound cofactor complex.

s47: "calmodulin", "CaM", "calcium-binding messenger protein"
Reason: s47 is named "CaM-Ca4" and "CaM-Ca2", indicating calmodulin in calcium-bound forms.

s48: "calcium-calmodulin complex", "CaM-Ca2", "calcium-bound calmodulin"
Reason: s48 is "CaM-Ca2", representing calmodulin bound to calcium.

s50: "endothelial nitric oxide synthase", "eNOS", "NOS3"
Reason: s50 is "eNOS-CaM-Ca2", indicating eNOS enzyme complexed with calmodulin and calcium.

s58: "Hsp90-eNOS-calcium-calmodulin complex", "Hsp90-eNOS-CaM-Ca4", "Hsp90-eNOS-Ca2"
Reason: s58 is "Hsp90-eNOS-CaM-Ca4", a complex involving Hsp90, eNOS, calmodulin, and calcium.

s60: "Hsp90-eNOS-calcium-calmodulin complex", "Hsp90-eNOS-CaM-Ca4", "Hsp90-eNOS-Ca2"
Reason: s60 is "Hsp90-p-eNOS-CaM-Ca4", similar to s58, indicating a phosphorylated eNOS complex with Hsp90 and calcium.

s61: "Hsp90-eNOS-calcium-calmodulin complex", "Hsp90-eNOS-CaM-Ca2", "Hsp90-eNOS-Ca2"
Reason: s61 is "Hsp90-eNOS-CaM-Ca2", similar complex with different calcium state.

s62: "Hsp90-eNOS-calcium-calmodulin complex", "Hsp90-eNOS-CaM-Ca2", "Hsp90-eNOS-Ca2"
Reason: s62 is "Hsp90-p-eNOS-CaM-Ca2", similar to s61, indicating phosphorylated form.

s63: "L-arginine", "arginine", "L-Arg"
Reason: s63 is "L-Arg", a standard amino acid substrate for eNOS.

s64: "nitric oxide", "NO", "nitrogen monoxide"
Reason: s64 is "NO", the product of eNOS activity.

Reason: The species are involved in nitric oxide synthesis regulation, calcium signaling, and chaperone complexes, with standard biochemical names assigned accordingly.
