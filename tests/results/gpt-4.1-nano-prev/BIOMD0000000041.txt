Synonyms:
ADPi: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP (nucleotide)']
ATPi: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP (nucleotide)']
Cri: ['creatine', 'creatine (compound)', 'UNK']
PCri: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate', 'PCr']
PCr: ['phosphocreatine', 'creatine phosphate', 'PCr']
ADP: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP (nucleotide)']
ATP: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP (nucleotide)']
Cr: ['creatine', 'creatine (compound)', 'UNK']
Pi: ['inorganic phosphate', 'phosphate', 'Pi']
P: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'Pi']

Reason: The model involves energy transfer molecules and phosphate compounds. Creatine and phosphocreatine are key energy buffers, and ADP/ATP are central to energy metabolism. Pi and P are inorganic phosphates involved in phosphorylation reactions. "Cri" and "PCri" are likely creatine and phosphocreatine, respectively. "ADPi" and "ATPi" are phosphorylated forms of ADP and ATP, respectively.
