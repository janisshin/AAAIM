Synonyms:
GLC: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
G6P_F6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'F6P']
F6P: ['fructose-6-phosphate', 'F6P', 'hexose phosphate']
FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'F1,6BP', 'FBP']
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'G3P', 'glyceraldehyde phosphate']
DHAP: ['dihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'DHAP', 'dihydroxyacetone phosphate']
DHAP_G3P: ['DHAP-G3P pool', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate pool', 'glycolytic triose phosphate pool']

Reason: all are key glycolytic intermediates; "G6P" and "F6P" are well-known phosphorylated sugars; "G3P" and "DHAP" are common glycolytic triose phosphates; "FBP" is a central glycolytic metabolite; "DHAP_G3P" refers to the combined pool of the two triose phosphates. "GLC" is a standard abbreviation for glucose.
