Synonyms:
Pa: ['phosphoric acid', 'orthophosphoric acid', 'inorganic phosphate']
Pb: ['lead', 'Pb2+', 'lead ion']
BDa: ['unknown', 'UNK', 'possibly a protein or complex']
BDb: ['unknown', 'UNK', 'possibly a protein or complex']

Reason: The species names are abbreviations without clear chemical context. "Pa" and "Pb" could suggest phosphoric acid and lead, respectively, but without explicit context, they are best guessed. "BDa" and "BDb" are ambiguous; no standard chemical names are provided, so they are labeled as unknown.
