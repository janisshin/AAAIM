Synonyms:
taRNA: ['trans-acting RNA', 'small regulatory RNA', 'synthetic RNA']
mT7cr: ['T7 promoter-reporter', 'T7-controlled construct', 'T7-driven gene']
mGFPcr: ['GFP reporter', 'green fluorescent protein', 'GFP construct']
ara: ['arabinose', 'L-arabinose', 'arabinose sugar']
mT3cr: ['T3 promoter-reporter', 'T3-controlled construct', 'T3-driven gene']

Reason: All species are synthetic or regulatory molecules used in genetic circuits; "ara" is a well-known sugar inducer. The others are engineered constructs or RNAs used in the model.
