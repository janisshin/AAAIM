Synonyms:
I: ['UNK']
E: ['adenylate pool', 'ATP', 'energy carrier']
A: ['adenylate pool', 'AMP', 'ADP']

Reason: I is an unspecified ion, likely a generic ion or unspecified species, so "UNK". E is labeled as "Energy pool" and "Adenylate pool," indicating adenylates like ATP, ADP, AMP. A is "Adenylate pool," which includes adenylates such as AMP, ADP, ATP; the model's context suggests these are the main adenylate species.
