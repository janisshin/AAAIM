Synonyms:
X_1: ['shikimate', 'shikimic acid', '3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid']
X_2: ['phenylalanine', 'L-phenylalanine', 'alpha-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid']
X_3: ['caffeoyl shikimate', 'caffeoyl-shikimate', 'caffeoyl-shikimate(2âˆ’)']
X_4: ['monolignol', 'coniferyl alcohol', 'pinoresinol']

Reason: The reactions involve shikimate biosynthesis, phenylalanine biosynthesis, and related phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates. X_1 is likely shikimate; X_2 is phenylalanine; X_3 and X_4 are intermediates/products in phenylpropanoid metabolism, with X_4 possibly being a monolignol or related compound.
