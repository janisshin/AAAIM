Synonyms:
s1: ['extracellular calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
s2: ['cytosolic calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
s3: ['cytosolic calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
s4: ['extracellular calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: s1 and s4 are labeled as Ca_ex and Ca_B, indicating extracellular calcium. s2 and s3 are involved in calcium signaling pathways, likely cytosolic calcium. The reactions suggest calcium movement between compartments, supporting these annotations. s6 (IP3) is a signaling molecule, not a calcium species.
