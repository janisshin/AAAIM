Synonyms:
Clkm: ['CLK mRNA', 'Clock gene mRNA', 'Circadian clock mRNA']
Perm: ['PER mRNA', 'Period gene mRNA', 'PER protein']
Timm: ['TIM mRNA', 'Timeless gene mRNA', 'Timeless protein']

Reason: All three are labeled as mRNA species related to circadian clock genes, corresponding to core clock components in Drosophila; their names suggest mRNA transcripts of clock genes.
