LAC: ['lactic acid', 'lactate', 'lactic acid (D-)']
GLY: ['glycerol', 'glycerine', 'glycerol (G)']
PYRin: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate (anion)']
G1P: ['glucose-1-phosphate', 'G1P', 'glucose-1-phosphate']
PYRout: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate (anion)']
OAA: ['oxaloacetate', 'oxaloacetate (dicarboxylic acid)', 'OAA']
GLCex: ['glucose', 'glucose (free)', 'd-glucose']
mRNA: ['messenger RNA', 'mRNA', 'RNA']

Reason: 
LAC is commonly lactic acid or lactate; GY is glycerol; PYRin and PYRout are both pyruvate; G1P is glucose-1-phosphate; OAA is oxaloacetate; GLCex is glucose; mRNA is messenger RNA. All are well-established biochemical entities.
