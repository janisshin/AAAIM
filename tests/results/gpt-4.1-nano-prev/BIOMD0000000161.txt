Synonyms:
PIP_PM: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PIP2', 'PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate)']

Reason: PIP2 is a common phospholipid involved in signaling, especially at the plasma membrane.

PI_PM: "phosphatidylinositol", "PI", "phosphatidylinositol (PI)"
Reason: PI is a phospholipid precursor to PIP2, located at the plasma membrane.

CaCAPRI_PM_PM: "calcium-dependent Ras GTPase-activating protein", "CAPRI", "RasGAP"
Reason: CaCAPRI likely refers to a calcium-activated Ras GTPase-activating protein, involved in Ras regulation.

PIP2_PM: "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate", "PIP2", "PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate)"
Reason: Same as PIP_PM, indicating PIP2 at the plasma membrane.

Ca: "calcium ion", "Ca2+", "calcium"
Reason: Ca is a common abbreviation for calcium ions.

RinhCa: "calcium inhibitor", "Ca inhibitor", "Ca channel blocker"
Reason: RinhCa likely refers to a calcium inhibitor or blocker affecting calcium signaling.

IP3: "inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate", "IP3", "InsP3"
Reason: IP3 is a well-known second messenger released from PIP2 hydrolysis.

Ca_RasGRP_GM_GM: "calcium-bound Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein", "RasGRP", "RasGRP (Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein)"
Reason: RasGRP is a calcium-sensitive GEF involved in Ras activation.

DAG_GM_GM: "diacylglycerol", "DAG", "diacylglycerol (DAG)"
Reason: DAG is a lipid second messenger produced from PIP2 hydrolysis.

CaCAPRI_cyt: "cytoplasmic calcium-dependent Ras GTPase-activating protein", "CAPRI", "RasGAP"
Reason: Similar to CaCAPRI_PM_PM, but localized in cytoplasm.

DAG_PM: "diacylglycerol", "DAG", "DAG (diacylglycerol)"
Reason: Same as DAG_GM_GM, indicating DAG at plasma membrane.

Ca_PLCe_cyt: "cytoplasmic calcium-activated phospholipase C epsilon", "PLCε", "phospholipase C epsilon"
Reason: PLCe is a phospholipase activated by calcium, involved in PIP2 hydrolysis.

Ras_CaPLCe_GM: "Ras activated by calcium-dependent PLC epsilon", "Ras", "Ras protein"
Reason: Ras associated with PLCε activity at the membrane.

PIP2_GM_GM: "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate", "PIP2", "PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate)"
Reason: Same as PIP2 at the Golgi membrane.

Ca_ER: "endoplasmic reticulum calcium", "ER calcium", "Ca2+ in ER"
Reason: Ca in ER stores calcium ions within the endoplasmic reticulum.

CaRasGRP1_cyt: "cytoplasmic Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein 1", "RasGRP1", "RasGRP1"
Reason: RasGRP1 is a specific isoform of RasGRP involved in Ras activation.
