Synonyms:
S: ['UNK']
O: ['UNK']
I1: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'cyclic ADP-ribose']
I2: ['inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate', 'IP4', 'cyclic ADP-ribose 4']

Reason: The model references IP3-dependent calcium oscillations; O is likely the IP3 receptor or IP3 itself, but no explicit name is given. I1 and I2 are likely different inositol trisphosphates, with I1 being the well-known IP3. S and O are unspecified, so labeled as "UNK".
