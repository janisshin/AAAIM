Synonyms:
Cytosolic_Rapamycin: ['rapamycin', 'sirolimus', 'rapamycin (cytosol)']
mTOR_Rapamycin: ['rapamycin', 'sirolimus', 'rapamycin (mTOR complex)']
mTORC1_Rapamycin: ['rapamycin', 'sirolimus', 'mTORC1 inhibitor']

Reason: All species involve rapamycin interacting with mTOR complexes; "cytosolic" indicates location, but the core compound is rapamycin. The mTORC1 species specifically refers to rapamycin's effect on mTORC1 complex.
