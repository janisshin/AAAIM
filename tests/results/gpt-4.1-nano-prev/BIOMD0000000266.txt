Synonyms:
X0: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
X1: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
X2: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P', 'glucose-6-phosphate']
X3: ['glucose-1-phosphate', 'G1P', 'glucose-1-phosphate']
X4: ['uridine diphosphate glucose', 'UDP-glucose', 'UDPG']
X5: ['glycogen', 'animal starch', 'glycogen']
X6: ['trehalose-6-phosphate', 'T6P', 'trehalose-6-phosphate']
X7: ['trehalose', 'maltose', 'mycose']

Reason: The model describes yeast trehalose cycle; X2 and X6 are intermediates G6P and T6P, X4 is UDP-glucose, X5 is glycogen, X7 is trehalose, and X1/X0 are glucose. "G1P" is a common name for glucose-1-phosphate.
