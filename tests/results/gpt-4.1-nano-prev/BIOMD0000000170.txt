Synonyms:
y1: ['PER2 mRNA', 'CRY2 mRNA', 'Per2 transcript']
y4: ['BMAL1 mRNA', 'ARNTL mRNA', 'Bmal1 transcript']

Reason: Both species are labeled as mRNA of specific circadian clock genes; "Per2" and "Cry" are associated with PER2 and CRY proteins, respectively, and "Bmal1" is a core clock gene. The synonyms reflect common naming conventions for these transcripts.
