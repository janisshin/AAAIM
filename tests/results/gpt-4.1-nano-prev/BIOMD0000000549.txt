Synonyms:
species_1: ['UNK']
species_2: ['pyridine phosphate', '(likely a phosphorylated pyridine derivative', 'common in biochemical contexts)']

Reason: The species labeled 'p' is ambiguous; it could be a placeholder or a generic variable. 'species_1' is simply 'a', which provides no biochemical context. The reaction involves 'species_2' as 'p', which is likely a small molecule, possibly pyridine phosphate or a similar phosphorylated heterocycle, given the notation. Without further context, the safest is to classify 'species_1' as unknown.
