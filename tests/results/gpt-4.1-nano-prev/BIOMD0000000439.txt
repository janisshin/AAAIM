RGSinertGaGTP: ['RGS-inhibited GTP-bound G protein', 'RGS-inhibited GTP-Galpha']
GaGDP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP']
P: ['inorganic phosphate', 'Pi']

Reason: The species are GTP, GDP, and phosphate, which are standard biochemical entities. The others are GTP-bound or GDP-bound G proteins, or related complexes, which are best represented by their common nucleotide forms or functional states.
