Synonyms:
c: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'cytoplasmic calcium']
cer: ['endoplasmic reticulum calcium', 'ER calcium', 'Ca2+ in ER']

Reason: Both are calcium concentrations in specific cellular compartments; "c" is cytosolic calcium, "cer" is ER calcium. The model focuses on calcium signaling, so these are the most relevant standardized names.
