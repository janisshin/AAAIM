Synonyms:
frq_mRNA: ['frq mRNA', 'frequency mRNA', 'frq transcript']

Reason: The species is the messenger RNA transcribed from the frq gene in Neurospora crassa, commonly referred to as frq mRNA or its transcript.

Species: degraded_frq_mRNA: "degraded frq mRNA", "frq mRNA degradation product", "frq transcript fragment"
Reason: Represents the degraded form of frq mRNA, a common term for the breakdown product of the frq transcript.

Species: frq_gene: "frq gene", "frequency gene", "frq locus"
Reason: The gene encoding the frq protein, a key component of the circadian clock in Neurospora.

Species: hypoFRQc: "hypoFRQ protein", "hypophosphorylated FRQ", "FRQ"
Reason: The species likely refers to a form of the FRQ protein, possibly hypophosphorylated, involved in the circadian feedback loop.
