Synonyms:
PABCa_D_Cytosol: ['phosphatidic acid', 'PA', 'diacylglycerol phosphate']

Reason: PABCa likely refers to phosphatidic acid in cytosol, a common lipid signaling molecule.

Ca_D_ER: "calcium", "Ca2+", "calcium ion"
Reason: Ca_D_ER indicates calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum, a well-known calcium store.

PABMg_D_Cytosol: "magnesium phosphate", "Mg2+", "magnesium ion"
Reason: PABMg suggests magnesium-related species, possibly magnesium phosphate or free Mg2+.

PABCa_Cytosol: "phosphatidic acid", "PA", "diacylglycerol phosphate"
Reason: Similar to PABCa_D_Cytosol, indicates phosphatidic acid in cytosol.

Mg_Cytosol: "magnesium", "Mg2+", "magnesium ion"
Reason: Mg is a common abbreviation for magnesium, a vital ion.

Ca_ER: "calcium", "Ca2+", "calcium ion"
Reason: Calcium in ER, a key calcium reservoir.

Ca_D_Cytosol: "calcium", "Ca2+", "calcium ion"
Reason: Calcium in cytosol, essential for signaling.

Ca_D_Extracellular: "calcium", "Ca2+", "extracellular calcium"
Reason: Calcium outside the cell, involved in signaling and homeostasis.

IP3_Cytosol: "inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate", "IP3", "inositol triphosphate"
Reason: IP3 is a signaling molecule that releases calcium from ER.

IP3_D_Cytosol: "inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate", "IP3", "inositol triphosphate"
Reason: Same as above, indicating IP3 in cytosol.

Mg_D_Cytosol: "magnesium", "Mg2+", "magnesium ion"
Reason: Magnesium in cytosol, involved in enzyme activity.

Ca_Cytosol: "calcium", "Ca2+", "cytosolic calcium"
Reason: Calcium in cytosol, central to signaling pathways.
