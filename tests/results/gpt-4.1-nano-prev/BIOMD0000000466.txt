Synonyms:
s102: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', 'GTP (guanosine triphosphate)']
s103: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', 'GDP (guanosine diphosphate)']

Reason: s102 and s103 are labeled as Ras:GTP and Ras:GDP, indicating they are GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ras, a small GTPase. The reactions suggest interconversion between these states.
