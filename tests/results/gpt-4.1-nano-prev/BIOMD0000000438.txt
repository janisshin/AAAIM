Synonyms:
s4: ['3-oxocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)acetate', '3OC12HSL', 'N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone']
s2: ['mRNA(LasR)', 'LasR mRNA', 'LasR transcript']

Reason: s4 is identified as 3OC12HSL, a well-known acyl homoserine lactone involved in quorum sensing; s2 is mRNA for LasR, a receptor protein, which is a nucleic acid molecule.
