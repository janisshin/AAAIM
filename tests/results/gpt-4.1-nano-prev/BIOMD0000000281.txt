Reason: The species are mostly known metabolites or cofactors involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism pathways. Some are specific enzyme intermediates or cofactors, which are best represented by their common biochemical names. "Dibromophenol" is a chemical compound, but given the context, it is best labeled as "UNK" for a biochemical species.
