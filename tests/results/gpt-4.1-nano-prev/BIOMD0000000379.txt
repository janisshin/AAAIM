Synonyms:
G_p: ['plasma glucose', 'blood glucose', 'glucose in plasma']
G_t: ['tissue glucose', 'interstitial glucose', 'cellular glucose']
Q_sto1: ['glucose storage', 'glycogen', 'glucose reservoir']
Q_gut: ['gut glucose', 'intestinal glucose', 'glucose in gut']
Q_sto2: ['second glucose store', 'additional glycogen', 'extra glucose reservoir']

Reason: G_p and G_t are likely plasma and tissue glucose levels; Q_sto1 and Q_sto2 are related to glucose storage or reservoirs; Q_gut refers to glucose in the gut, all consistent with glucose-insulin system modeling.
