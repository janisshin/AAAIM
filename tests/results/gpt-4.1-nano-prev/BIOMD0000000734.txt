Synonyms:
FeDuo: ['ferric duodenal', 'iron duodenal', 'FeDuo']

Reason: Likely a ferric iron species in the duodenum, a common site for iron absorption.

FeDuo_0: "ferric duodenal", "iron duodenal", "FeDuo"
Reason: Same as above, with "_0" indicating initial or baseline state.

FeRBC: "ferric red blood cell", "iron RBC", "FeRBC"
Reason: Represents iron within red blood cells, a common form of stored or transported iron.

FeRBC_0: "ferric red blood cell", "iron RBC", "FeRBC"
Reason: Same as above, initial or baseline state.

FeSpleen: "spleen iron", "iron spleen", "FeSpleen"
Reason: Iron stored or present in spleen tissue.

FeSpleen_0: "spleen iron", "iron spleen", "FeSpleen"
Reason: Baseline or initial spleen iron.

FeLiver: "liver iron", "hepatic iron", "FeLiver"
Reason: Iron stored in liver tissue.

FeLiver_0: "liver iron", "hepatic iron", "FeLiver"
Reason: Baseline or initial liver iron.

Fe2Tf: "ferrous transferrin", "Fe(II) transferrin", "Fe2Tf"
Reason: Transferrin bound to ferrous (Fe2+) iron, a common transport form.

NTBI: "non-transferrin bound iron", "free iron", "NTBI"
Reason: Iron not bound to transferrin, often labile or circulating free iron.

Fe1Tf: "ferric transferrin", "Fe(III) transferrin", "Fe1Tf"
Reason: Transferrin bound to ferric (Fe3+) iron, the main transport form.

Fe2Tf_0: "ferrous transferrin", "Fe(II) transferrin", "Fe2Tf"
Reason: Same as Fe2Tf, baseline state.

Fe1Tf_0: "ferric transferrin", "Fe(III) transferrin", "Fe1Tf"
Reason: Same as Fe1Tf, initial state.

NTBI_0: "non-transferrin bound iron", "free iron", "NTBI"
Reason: Baseline or initial free iron.

Fe2Tf_: "ferrous transferrin", "Fe(II) transferrin", "Fe2Tf"
Reason: Same as Fe2Tf, possibly a different compartment or state.

FeRest: "resting iron", "tissue iron", "FeRest"
Reason: Iron stored or present in tissues, not actively transported.

FeOutside: "extracellular iron", "outside cell iron", "FeOutside"
Reason: Iron outside cells or in extracellular space.

FeRest_0: "resting iron", "tissue iron", "FeRest"
Reason: Baseline tissue iron.

FeOutside_0: "extracellular iron", "outside cell iron", "FeOutside"
Reason: Initial extracellular iron.

FeBM: "bone marrow iron", "hematopoietic iron", "FeBM"
Reason: Iron in bone marrow, involved in erythropoiesis.

FeBM_0: "bone marrow iron", "hematopoietic iron", "FeBM"
Reason: Baseline bone marrow iron.

Reason: All species are related to iron forms or locations in biological tissues, with standard names aligning with common biochemical terminology.
