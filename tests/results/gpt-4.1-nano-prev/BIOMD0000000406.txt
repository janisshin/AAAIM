Synonyms:
s91: ['deoxyribonucleic acid', 'DNA', 'DNA molecule']
s92: ['deoxyribonucleic acid', 'DNA', 'DNA molecule']
s157: ['unknown', 'UNK', 'unspecified']

Reason: s91 and s92 are labeled as 'repldna' and 'irepldna', indicating DNA or DNA-related molecules involved in replication. s157 is labeled as 'UDNA', which is ambiguous and likely refers to an unspecified or unknown DNA species.
