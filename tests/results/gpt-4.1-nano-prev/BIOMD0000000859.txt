Synonyms:
sucr: ['sucrose', 'table sugar', 'sucrose (disaccharide)']
EtrioseP: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'triose phosphate', 'g3p']
Ephe: ['phe', 'phenylalanine', 'phenylalanine (amino acid)']
N: ['nitrogen', 'ammonia', 'ammonium']
starch: ['starch', 'amylose', 'amylopectin']
Next: ['UNK']
Enitrate: ['nitrate', 'nitrate ion', 'NO3âˆ’']
trioseP: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'triose phosphate', 'g3p']
ECO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'dioxide']
Estarch: ['starch', 'amylose', 'amylopectin']

Reason: The reactions involve common metabolic intermediates and molecules; "sucr" is sucrose, "starch" and "Estarch" are starch, "ECO2" is CO2, "N" is nitrogen, "Enitrate" is nitrate, and "trioseP" is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. "EtrioseP" and "Ephe" are likely the same as "trioseP" and phenylalanine, respectively. "Next" is undefined.
