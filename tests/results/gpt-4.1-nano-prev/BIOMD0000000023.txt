Reason: 
Fru and Glc are common monosaccharides, well-known sugars.
HexP likely refers to a hexose phosphate, such as glucose-6-phosphate.
Suc6P is a sucrose-6-phosphate, a known intermediate.
Suc and Sucvac are sucrose, with "vac" possibly indicating vacuolar or extracellular form.
glycolysis is a metabolic pathway involving glucose breakdown.
phos, UDP, ADP, ATP are common inorganic and nucleotide phosphates.
Glcex and Fruex are likely extracellular or exported forms of glucose and fructose.
