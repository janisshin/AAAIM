Synonyms:
uninfected_tumor_cells: ['tumor cells', 'neoplastic cells', 'cancer cells']
infected_tumor_cells: ['infected tumor cells', 'virus-infected cancer cells', 'oncolytic virus-infected cells']
overall_tumor_size: ['tumor burden', 'tumor mass', 'cancer volume']

Reason: These are standard terms for tumor cell populations and tumor size metrics in cancer modeling; the species are not biochemical entities but cell populations, so normalized names are general cancer-related terms.
