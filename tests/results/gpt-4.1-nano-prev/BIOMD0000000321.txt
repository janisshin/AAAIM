Synonyms:
A_dopa: ['L-dopa', 'levodopa', '3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine']
C_dopa: ['dopamine', 'dopamine', '3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine']
C_OMD: ['3-O-methyldopa', '3-O-methyl-DOPA', '3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylalanine']

Reason: The model references L-dopa (A_dopa), its methylated metabolite 3-OMD (C_OMD), and the reaction involving C_dopa, which is likely dopamine, a common catecholamine derived from L-dopa.
