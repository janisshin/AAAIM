Synonyms:
uninfected_cancer_cells: ['cancer cell', 'tumor cell', 'malignant cell']
infected_cancer_cells: ['infected tumor cell', 'virus-infected cancer cell', 'oncogenic cell']

Reason: Both species refer to cell populations involved in cancer; the uninfected are normal cancer cells, while infected are those infected by the virus used in virotherapy. They are standard terms for tumor biology and virotherapy contexts.
