Synonyms:
sucr: ['sucrose', 'sucrose (common name)', 'sucrose (chemical name)']
EtrioseP: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'triose phosphate', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate']
Ephe: ['ephe', 'ephe (unknown)', 'UNK']
N: ['nitrogen', 'ammonia', 'UNK']
starch: ['starch', 'amylose', 'amylopectin']
Next: ['UNK']
Enitrate: ['nitrate', 'nitrate ion', 'UNK']
trioseP: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'triose phosphate', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate']
ECO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'dioxide']
Estarch: ['starch', 'amylose', 'amylopectin']

Reason: The model involves common metabolic intermediates and compounds; "sucr" is sucrose, "trioseP" is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, "ECO2" is CO2, "starch" is starch. "EtrioseP" and "Estarch" are variants of the same compounds. "Ephe" and "Next" are unclear or not standard chemical entities, so labeled as "UNK". "Enitrate" is nitrate.
