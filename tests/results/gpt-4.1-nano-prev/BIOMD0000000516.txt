Reason: All are standard biochemical names for metabolites involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, or common cofactors. Species like Fru_e, Fru_g, Fru_c are different compartments of fructose, which are all recognized as fructose. NADPH/NADP, NADH/NAD, ATP/ADP/AMP are well-established nucleotides. Inorganic phosphate, oxygen, and carbon dioxide are common inorganic molecules. The abbreviations for phosphorylated sugars and key intermediates are standard. Species like Gly_e (glycine) and TSH2_c (thiosulfate) are recognized small molecules. "UNK" is not appropriate here because all species are identifiable as known metabolites.
