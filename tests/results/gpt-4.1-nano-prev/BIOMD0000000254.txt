Synonyms:
G1: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T1: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'energy molecule']
G2: ['glucose', 'd-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T2: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'energy molecule']

Reason: G1 and G2 are both glucose molecules involved in glycolysis; T1 and T2 are ATP molecules, the primary energy currency in cells. The model references glycolytic oscillations, which involve glucose and ATP as key metabolites.
