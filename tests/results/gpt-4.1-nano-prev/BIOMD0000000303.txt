Synonyms:
PC: ['phosphatidylcholine', 'lecithin', 'PC']

Reason: PC commonly refers to phosphatidylcholine, a major phospholipid in cell membranes and lipoproteins.

PC_CRP: "phosphatidylcholine", "lecithin", "PC"
Reason: PC is the same as above; combined with CRP (C-reactive protein), likely indicating a complex or association involving phosphatidylcholine.

PC_CRP_C1: "phosphatidylcholine", "lecithin", "PC"
Reason: Same as above; C1 likely denotes a specific form or complex involving phosphatidylcholine.

GlcNac: "N-acetylglucosamine", "GlcNAc", "NAG"
Reason: GlcNac is a standard abbreviation for N-acetylglucosamine, a monosaccharide involved in glycosylation.

GlcNac_LF: "N-acetylglucosamine", "GlcNAc", "NAG"
Reason: Same as above; LF indicates a specific form or context, but the core compound remains N-acetylglucosamine.

GlcNac_LF_MASP: "N-acetylglucosamine", "GlcNAc", "NAG"
Reason: Same core compound; MASP is a protease in the lectin pathway, but the species is still GlcNAc.

PC_CRP_LF: "phosphatidylcholine", "lecithin", "PC"
Reason: PC as above; combined with CRP and LF, indicating a complex involving phosphatidylcholine.

PC_CRP_LF_MASP: "phosphatidylcholine", "lecithin", "PC"
Reason: Same as above; the species is a complex involving PC, CRP, LF, and MASP.

GlcNac_LF_CRP: "N-acetylglucosamine", "GlcNAc", "NAG"
Reason: Core compound is GlcNAc; LF and CRP are proteins or complexes associated with the complement system.

GlcNac_LF_CRP_C1: "N-acetylglucosamine", "GlcNAc", "NAG"
Reason: Same as above; C1 indicates a specific complex or form.

C4BP_PC_CRP: "C4b-binding protein", "C4BP", "complement regulator"
Reason: C4BP is a known complement regulatory protein.

C4BP_GlcNac_LF_CRP: "C4b-binding protein", "C4BP", "complement regulator"
Reason: Same as above; the species involves C4BP and glycan or protein complexes.

PC_CRP_LF_C1: "phosphatidylcholine", "lecithin", "PC"
Reason: As above, a complex involving PC, CRP, LF, and C1.

C4BP_PC_CRP_LF: "C4b-binding protein", "C4BP", "complement regulator"
Reason: Same as above; complex involving C4BP, PC, CRP, LF.

Species with no specific name: "UNK"
Reason: The species are abbreviations of complexes or molecules, but without explicit biochemical identities, they are best classified as unknown.

Reason: All species are abbreviations or complex labels related to complement system components; most are not standard chemical entities but protein complexes or glycans.
