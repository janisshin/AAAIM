Synonyms:
x1: ['arachidonic acid', 'arachidonic acid', 'ARA']

Reason: x1 is labeled as 'AA' in the display names, which is a common abbreviation for arachidonic acid, a well-known precursor in eicosanoid pathways.

x2: "15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid", "15-HPETE", "15-HETE"
Reason: x2 is '15-HPETE' in display names; HPETE is hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 15-HPETE is a specific hydroxylated derivative.

x3: "15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid", "15-HETE", "15-HETE"
Reason: x3 is '15-HETE', a hydroxylated derivative of arachidonic acid involved in inflammatory pathways.

x4: "12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid", "12-HPETE", "12-HETE"
Reason: x4 is '12-HPETE', a hydroperoxy derivative of arachidonic acid.

x5: "12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid", "12-HETE", "12-HETE"
Reason: x5 is '12-HETE', a hydroxylated derivative involved in inflammatory responses.

x6: "prostaglandin H2", "PGH2", "Prostaglandin H2"
Reason: x6 is 'PGH2', a key intermediate in prostaglandin synthesis.

x7: "prostaglandin E2", "PGE2", "Prostaglandin E2"
Reason: x7 is 'PGE2', a well-known prostaglandin involved in inflammation.

x8: "thromboxane A2", "TXA2", "Thromboxane A2"
Reason: x8 is 'TXA2', a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator.

x9: "thromboxane B2", "TXB2", "Thromboxane B2"
Reason: x9 is 'TXB2', the stable metabolite of TXA2.

x10: "5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid", "5-HPETE", "5-HETE"
Reason: x10 is '5-HPETE', a hydroperoxy derivative of arachidonic acid.

x11: "5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid", "5-HETE", "5-HETE"
Reason: x11 is '5-HETE', a hydroxylated derivative involved in leukotriene synthesis.

x12: "leukotriene A4", "LTA4", "Leukotriene A4"
Reason: x12 is 'LTA4', an unstable leukotriene precursor.

x13: "leukotriene B4", "LTB4", "Leukotriene B4"
Reason: x13 is 'LTB4', a potent chemoattractant in inflammation.

x14: "w-LTB4" (likely a typo or variant of LTB4), "LTB4", "Leukotriene B4"
Reason: x14 is 'w-LTB4', probably a variant or typo for LTB4, which is a key inflammatory mediator.

Reason: The species are all related to arachidonic acid metabolism, with well-established names and common synonyms for eicosanoids and leukotrienes.
