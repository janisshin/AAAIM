Reason: The species are mostly metabolites involved in glycolysis, with some specific to compartments or external environments. "Pyr" is pyruvate, a key glycolytic product, and "Gly" is glycerol, a related metabolite. "Pg" is inorganic phosphate, common in energy metabolism. External and compartment-specific species are distinguished accordingly.
