Synonyms:
RCC1_RanGTP: ['Ran GTP', 'Ran GTPase', 'Ran GTP complex']
RCC1_RanGDP: ['Ran GDP', 'Ran GDP complex', 'Ran GTPase']
GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: All are well-known nucleotide forms involved in Ran GTPase cycling; "Ran GTP" and "Ran GDP" are common synonyms for the active/inactive forms, and "GDP"/"GTP" are standard nucleotide names.
