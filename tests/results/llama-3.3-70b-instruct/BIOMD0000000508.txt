Synonyms:
ip3: ['inositol trisphosphate', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
atp: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
y: ['UNK']
ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: ip3 is likely inositol trisphosphate due to its common involvement in cell signaling pathways, atp is a well-known energy transfer molecule, y has no clear display name or reaction to identify it, and ca is likely calcium due to its role in cell signaling and the model's description of calcium-cell cycle coupling.
