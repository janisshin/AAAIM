Synonyms:
G: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood glucose']
I: ['insulin', 'human insulin', 'insulin hormone']
B: ['beta-cell mass', 'cell mass', 'islet cell mass']

Reason: G is annotated as "glucose" due to the display name and the context of the model, which is related to glucose kinetics and diabetes. I is annotated as "insulin" due to the display name and its role in the model as a hormone. B is annotated as "beta-cell mass" due to the display name and the context of the model, which describes the dynamics of beta-cell mass in relation to glucose and insulin.
