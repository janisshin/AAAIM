Synonyms:
ET: ['ethylene', 'ethene', 'C2H4']
IAA: ['indole-3-acetic acid', 'indoleacetic acid', 'auxin']
ACC: ['1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid', 'ACC', '1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate']

Reason: ET is likely ethylene, a plant hormone, due to its involvement in the reactions and the model's focus on hormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis. IAA is likely indole-3-acetic acid, a form of auxin, as it is directly related to Auxin in the reactions. ACC is likely 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, a precursor to ethylene, as it is converted to ET in the reaction v_Ethylene.
