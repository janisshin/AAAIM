Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'glycerate 3-phosphate']
Ru5P: ['ribulose-5-phosphate', 'ribulose 5-phosphate', 'ru5p']
UTP: ["uridine 5'-triphosphate", 'uridine triphosphate', 'utp']
UDP: ["uridine 5'-diphosphate", 'uridine diphosphate', 'udp']
Pi: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'orthophosphate']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'co2', 'carbonic acid']
Suc: ['sucrose', 'table sugar', 'saccharose']
Pic: ['inorganic phosphate', 'phosphate', 'pi']
SucV: ['UNK']

Reason: The species can be identified based on their display names and the context of the Calvin cycle model. RuBP, PGA, Ru5P, UTP, UDP, Pi, CO2, and Suc are all known intermediates or substrates in the Calvin cycle or related metabolic pathways. Pic is likely a duplicate of Pi, representing inorganic phosphate. SucV is unknown as it does not have a clear display name or reaction to identify its chemical entity.
