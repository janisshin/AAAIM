Synonyms:
Z: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Y: ['UNK']

Reason: Z is likely calcium because the model simulates calcium spikes and intracellular calcium levels, and the reactions involve Z being produced and consumed, consistent with calcium dynamics. Y is unknown because no display names are given and its reactions with Z do not provide enough information to determine its identity.
