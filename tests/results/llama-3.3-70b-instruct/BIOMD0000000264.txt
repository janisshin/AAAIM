Synonyms:
EGFR_i: ['epidermal growth factor receptor', 'EGF receptor', 'ERBB1']
EGF_EGFR_i: ['UNK']

Reason: EGFR_i is likely the epidermal growth factor receptor, a protein that plays a key role in cell signaling, due to the mention of "EGF receptor" and "EGFR" in the model notes. EGF_EGFR_i is unknown because it does not have a clear display name or description that matches a known chemical entity.
