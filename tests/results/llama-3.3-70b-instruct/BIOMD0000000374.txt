Synonyms:
Ca_er_Ca_equations: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', '"calcium']
Ca_i: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', '"calcium']

Reason: Both Ca_er_Ca_equations and Ca_i are likely referring to calcium ions, as the model is related to calcium release-activated current (CRAC) in pancreatic beta-cells and the display names and reactions suggest calcium ion concentrations in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and inside (i) the cell.
