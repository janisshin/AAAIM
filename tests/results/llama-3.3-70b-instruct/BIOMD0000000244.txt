Reason: The model appears to be a metabolic model of E. coli, and the species names are matched to common biochemical names based on the reactions and display names provided. The species with multiple possible names (e.g. ACT, ACoA) are matched to the most likely names based on their roles in the reactions. The species with less clear names (e.g. CraFBP, CrpcAMP, PdhRPYR) are matched to names based on their display names and the context of the model.
