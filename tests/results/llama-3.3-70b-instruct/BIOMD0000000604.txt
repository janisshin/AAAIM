Reason: The species were annotated based on their display names and reaction equations. For species with "_i" or "_e" suffixes, they were assumed to be the same chemical entity as their counterparts without the suffix, with the suffix indicating intracellular or extracellular location. The annotations for G6P and F16DP were based on common biochemical nomenclature. The reactions provided context for the likely biochemical pathways involved, such as glycolysis and fermentation, which helped confirm the annotations.
