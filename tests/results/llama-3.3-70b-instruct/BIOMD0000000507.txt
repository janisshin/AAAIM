Synonyms:
species_3: ['isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside', 'isopropylthiogalactoside', 'IPTG']

Reason: The display name 'IPTG' is a common abbreviation for isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, a molecule commonly used in molecular biology to induce gene expression. The model context and notes provide no contradictory information, making these names the most likely standardized names for species_3.
