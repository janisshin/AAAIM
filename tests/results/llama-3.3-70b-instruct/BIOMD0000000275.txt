Synonyms:
RA: ['retinoic acid', 'vitamin A acid', 'all-trans retinoic acid']

Reason: The model "goldbeter2007" is described in a publication that mentions "retinoic acid (RA)" as a key component, and the reactions involving RA (such as synthesis, decay, and degradation by Cyp26) are consistent with the known biochemical properties of retinoic acid.
