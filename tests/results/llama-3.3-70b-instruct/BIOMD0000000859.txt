Synonyms:
sucr: ['sucrose', 'table sugar', 'α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-fructofuranoside']
Ephe: ['UNK']
N: ['nitrogen', 'nitrate', 'azote']
Next: ['UNK']
Enitrate: ['nitrate', 'nitric acid', 'nitrate ion']
ECO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']

Reason: sucr is likely sucrose due to the reaction 'Sucrose_Formation_TrioseP' and 'Sucrose_Consumption' reactions. Ephe and Next are unknown as there are no clear indications of their chemical identities. N is likely nitrogen or nitrate due to the 'N_Formation' and 'N_Consumption' reactions, but without more context, it's hard to determine if it's an ion or a molecule. Enitrate is likely nitrate due to its name and the 'Enitrate_Formation' and 'Enitrate_Consumption' reactions. ECO2 is likely carbon dioxide due to the 'ECO2_Formation' and 'ECO2_Consumption' reactions and the 'CO2' in its name.
