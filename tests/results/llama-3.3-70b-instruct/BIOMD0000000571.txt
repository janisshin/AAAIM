Reason: The species with "CRP_cAMP" and other related names are likely related to the cAMP-bound CRP complex, but without more information, they cannot be accurately identified. The species cAMP, Pyr, PEP, Glc6P, Glucose, and ATP are all common biochemical molecules with well-established names. The other species are unknown due to lack of information.
