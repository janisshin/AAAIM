Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding standardized names based on the display names and reaction equations provided in the model. The suffixes "_i" and "_e" were interpreted as indicating intracellular and extracellular compartments, respectively, but did not affect the chemical identity of the species. The reaction equations and display names provided sufficient information to determine the chemical identities of all species, with the exception of none, as all species had clear matches to known biochemical compounds.
