Synonyms:
Sulphate__PAPS: ["3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate", 'PAPS', 'phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate']
GSH: ['glutathione', 'reduced glutathione', 'L-glutathione']

Reason: Sulphate__PAPS is likely 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, a common cofactor in sulfation reactions, given its involvement in the Reddyhoff2015 model of acetaminophen metabolism. GSH is likely glutathione, a well-known antioxidant, due to its participation in reactions related to acetaminophen metabolism and toxicity.
