Synonyms:
Z: ['protein', 'phosphoprotein', 'phosphorylated protein']
Y: ['phosphorylated protein', 'protein', 'phosphoprotein']

Reason: The model is named "Dupont1992_Ca_dpt_protein_phospho" and reproduces a figure related to phosphorylated protein, suggesting that Z and Y are related to protein phosphorylation. The reactions also indicate a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation between Z and Y, consistent with protein phosphorylation dynamics.
