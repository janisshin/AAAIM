Reason: The species are annotated based on their display names and the context of the liver iron metabolism model. species_24 is likely ferritin, a protein that stores iron, due to its reaction with species_2 (lipid) and species_25 ( likely apoferritin). species_26 is likely transferrin, a protein that binds iron, due to its reaction with species_2 and species_25. species_5 is likely heme, a molecule containing iron, due to its display name and reaction with species_11 (also likely heme). species_2 is likely a lipid or lipoprotein, due to its reaction with species_24 and species_26. The other species are annotated based on their display names and the context of the model, with species_43 being a transferrin-iron complex, and the others being various complexes of transferrin, iron, and transferrin receptors. species_11 is likely heme, due to its display name and reaction with species_5.
