Reason: The species were annotated based on their display names and reaction equations. For species with "_i" or "_e" suffixes, they were assumed to be the same chemical entity as their suffix-less counterparts, with the suffix indicating intracellular or extracellular location. F16DP was annotated as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate based on its involvement in glycolytic reactions. G6P was annotated as glucose-6-phosphate based on its display name and reaction equations.
