Reason: The species can be identified based on their display names and reaction equations. mw8f5a7b5c_ca4c_4a4c_85b1_e5d640c426bf and mwa54a9c38_c98b_45e5_8432_4119fb777e44 are likely GDP and GTP, respectively, as they are involved in reactions with Ras proteins. mwf40d6176_abfc_4a30_886f_83a19fcffc48 and mw28464aad_8013_4a23_ae09_a406954859a6 are likely Ras-GDP, given their display names and reaction equations. mwdf82303e_323f_4c51_a858_56a59233cd98 is likely Ras-GTP, based on its display name and reaction equation. mw83de7813_4941_45a6_a320_a551165bf22a is likely Raf1, given its display name and reaction equation. mwd7bf31ba_b05c_4c45_bb2f_6a2468a2a507 cannot be identified with certainty, as its display name is a complex protein complex and its reaction equation does not provide clear information about its chemical identity.
