Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose 1,5-diphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'phosphoglycerate']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'dioxide carbon']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'molecular oxygen']

Reason: The model is a representation of the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is a series of biochemical reactions that occur in the stroma of chloroplasts and is a critical part of photosynthesis. RuBP is a key substrate in this cycle, PGA is a product of the RuBisCO reaction, NADPH is a reducing agent, CO2 is the carbon source, and O2 is a byproduct of the light-dependent reactions. The display names and reactions provided in the model match the expected biochemical roles of these species, allowing for confident annotation with standardized names.
