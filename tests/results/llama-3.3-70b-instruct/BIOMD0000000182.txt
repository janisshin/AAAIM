Synonyms:
G_GDP_cyto: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate']
ATP_cyto: ['ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
AMP_cyto: ['AMP', 'adenosine monophosphate', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]
cAMP_cyto: ['cAMP', 'cyclic AMP', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate']

Reason: The model description and notes mention the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, indicating that G_GDP_cyto is likely GDP, ATP_cyto is ATP, AMP_cyto is AMP, and cAMP_cyto is cyclic AMP, which are all common molecules in cellular signaling pathways.
