Synonyms:
c: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
cer: ['ceramide', 'sphingosine', 'ceramide molecule']
g6p: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'D-glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P']
fbp: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBP']
adp: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP molecule', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]

Reason: The species names are annotated based on their display names and the context of the model, which is a pancreatic beta-cell model involving glycolysis and calcium dynamics. 'c' is likely calcium due to its involvement in the model's bursting behavior and the mention of "cytosolic Ca2+" in the article. 'cer' is less clear, but ceramide is a possible match given its biological relevance. 'g6p' and 'fbp' are likely glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, respectively, due to their roles in glycolysis. 'adp' is likely adenosine diphosphate, a common energy transfer molecule in cellular biology.
