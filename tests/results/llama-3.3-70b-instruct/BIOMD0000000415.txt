Synonyms:
species_1: ['linoleic acid', 'LA', 'cis,cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid']

Reason: The display name 'LA' is a common abbreviation for linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid involved in the lipoxygenase pathway, which is the focus of the model. The other species are likely related to linoleic acid derivatives or metabolites, but without more information, they cannot be accurately identified.
