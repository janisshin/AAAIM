Reason: The standardized names and common synonyms were determined based on the display names provided in the model and common knowledge of biochemical compounds. For species with display names that directly correspond to common biochemical compounds (e.g. ATP, NAD), the standardized names were straightforward. For species with less common or more specific display names (e.g. G6P, FBP), the standardized names were determined based on common synonyms and abbreviations used in biochemistry. For species with display names that indicate a specific location or context (e.g. GlcX, GlycX), the standardized names were determined based on the underlying biochemical compound, with the location or context taken into account where relevant. Species with unclear or ambiguous display names (e.g. CNX0) were assigned standardized names based on the most likely interpretation, but with a lower degree of confidence.
