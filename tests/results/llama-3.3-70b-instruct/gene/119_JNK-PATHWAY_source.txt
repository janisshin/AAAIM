sa4: ['MAP2K4', 'MKK4', 'SEK1']
sa5: ['MAP2K7', 'MKK7', 'MEK7']
sa12: ['BCL2', 'BCL2L1', 'BCL2L2']
sa33: ['ATF2', 'CREBP1', 'HB16']
sa34: ['TP53', 'P53', 'TUMOR SUPPRESSOR P53']

Reason: The annotations are based on the display names provided, where sa4 is MAP2K4_phosphorylated, sa5 is MAP2K7_phosphorylated, sa12 is BCL2_phosphorylated, sa33 is ATF2_phosphorylated, and sa34 is TP53_phosphorylated, which directly correspond to the standardized gene names.
