Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose 1,5-biphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'phosphoglycerate']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'molecular oxygen']

Reason: The model is based on the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is a series of biochemical reactions that occur in photosynthesis, and the reactions provided match the known reactions of this cycle, allowing for the identification of the species as known biochemical compounds. RuBP is a substrate in the cycle, PGA is a product, NADPH is a reducing agent, CO2 is a reactant, and O2 is not directly involved in the reactions provided but is a byproduct of photosynthesis.
