Synonyms:
Galpha_GTP: ['GTP-bound G alpha subunit', 'Galpha-GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate-bound G alpha']
IP3: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']
Ca_ER: ['calcium(2+) ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_Cyt: ['calcium(2+) ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
DG: ['1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol', 'diacylglycerol', 'diglyceride']

Reason: Galpha_GTP is likely a G-protein alpha subunit bound to GTP, IP3 is a well-known second messenger, Ca_ER and Ca_Cyt are calcium ions in different compartments, and DG is diacylglycerol, a common intermediate in cell signaling pathways, as inferred from the display names, reactions, and model description.
