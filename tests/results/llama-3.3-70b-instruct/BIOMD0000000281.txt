Reason: The model is a biochemical model of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and most species can be identified as common biochemical compounds based on their display names and reaction equations. Some species, such as ENG, ETG, MOD, MOB, and PPP, are less clear and may represent intermediate or complex species, so "UNK" is included as a possible name. The reaction equations and display names provide context for identifying the species, but some species may have multiple possible names or may not be easily identifiable.
