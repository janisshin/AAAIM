Synonyms:
h1: ['hydrogen ion', 'proton', 'H+']
x1: ['activation variable', 'gating variable', 'ion channel activator']
n1: ['inactivation variable', 'gating variable', 'ion channel inactivator']
c: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', '"calcium']

Reason: The model is a mathematical representation of a nerve cell, and the variables h1, x1, and n1 are likely related to ion channel gating, which is a common mechanism in neuronal models. The variable c is likely representing calcium ions, which play a crucial role in neuronal signaling. The display names and reactions provided do not give clear chemical identities, but based on the context of the model and the article, these annotations are the most plausible.
