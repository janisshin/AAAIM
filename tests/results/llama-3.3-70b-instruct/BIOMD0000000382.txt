Synonyms:
z: ['glucose', 'insulin', 'UNK']

Reason: The model is related to insulin and glucose regulation, and 'z' is a key component in the reaction equation, but its display name is unclear, making it difficult to determine a specific chemical entity. Glucose and insulin are likely candidates due to the model's context, but without more information, 'z' could represent another factor in the glucose-insulin feedback loop.
