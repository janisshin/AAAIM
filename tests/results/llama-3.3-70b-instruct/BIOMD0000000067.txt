Synonyms:
AcCoA: ['acetyl-CoA', 'acetyl coenzyme A', 'CoA acetyl']
AcP: ['acetyl phosphate', 'acetic phosphate', 'phosphoacetic acid']
OAc: ['acetate', 'acetic acid', 'ethanoate']
HOAc: ['acetic acid', 'ethanoic acid', 'protonated acetate']
HOAc_E: ['UNK']

Reason: AcCoA, AcP, OAc, and HOAc can be annotated based on their display names and reactions in the model, which are consistent with common biochemical nomenclature. HOAc_E is annotated as "UNK" because it represents "acetate export", which is a process or a location rather than a chemical entity.
