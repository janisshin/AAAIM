Synonyms:
X_1: ['shikimate', 'shikimic acid', '3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid']
X_2: ['prephenate', 'phenylalanine', 'L-phenylalanine']
X_3: ['caffeoyl-shikimate', 'caffeic acid', '3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid']
X_4: ['UNK']

Reason: The reactions suggest that X_1 is shikimate due to the "Shikimate_Biosynthesis" reaction, X_2 is likely prephenate or phenylalanine given its involvement in "Phenylalanine_Biosynthesis_Shikimate", X_3 is possibly caffeoyl-shikimate or caffeic acid due to the "Caffeoyl_Shikimate_Biosynthesis" reaction, and X_4 is unknown as its reactants and products do not provide clear identification.
