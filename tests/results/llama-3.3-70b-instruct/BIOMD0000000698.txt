Synonyms:
Methionine: ['methionine', 'L-methionine', 'L-methionine(z)']
AdoMet: ['S-adenosylmethionine', 'AdoMet', 'S-adenosyl-L-methionine']
Homocysteine: ['homocysteine', 'L-homocysteine', 'homocysteine(z)']
Cystathionine: ['cystathionine', 'L-cystathionine', 'cystathionine(z)']

Reason: The model is described as the methionine cycle, and the display names and reactions match the biochemical pathway. Methionine, AdoMet, Homocysteine, and Cystathionine are all known intermediates in this cycle, allowing for confident identification of their standardized names.
