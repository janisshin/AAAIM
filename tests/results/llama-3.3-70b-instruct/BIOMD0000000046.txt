Synonyms:
NADH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NADH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'molecular oxygen']
H2O2: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'peroxide', 'dihydrogen dioxide']
ArH: ['UNK']
Ar: ['UNK']
NADrad: ['UNK']
super: ['superoxide', 'superoxide anion', 'oxide(1-)']
NAD2: ['UNK']
NAD: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NAD+', 'oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
O2g: ['oxygen gas', 'dioxygen gas', 'gaseous oxygen']
NADHres: ['reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']

Reason: NADH, O2, H2O2, NAD, and super have well-known biochemical roles and are easily identifiable. NADHres is likely a reservoir or reserve form of NADH. ArH and Ar are unknown due to lack of context, NADrad is unclear but may be a radical form of NAD, NAD2 is unclear but may be a dimer or other form of NAD, and O2g is likely a gas-phase form of oxygen but the 'g' notation is not standard.
