Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
Z: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']
A: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']
Y: ['calcium ion', 'calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+']

Reason: EC, Z, and Y are all related to calcium, with EC being extracellular, Z being cytosolic, and Y being intravesicular, so they are all annotated as calcium ion or its synonyms. A is annotated as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate based on its display name IP3, which is a common abbreviation for this molecule.
