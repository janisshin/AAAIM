Synonyms:
Gp: ['glutamate', 'L-glutamic acid', 'glutamic acid']
Gi: ['glutamate', 'L-glutamic acid', 'glutamic acid']
A: ['ammonia', 'ammonium', 'nitrogen oxide']

Reason: Gp and Gi are likely "glutamate" due to the reaction names, and A is likely "ammonia" as it is produced from the consumption of glutamate and is involved in diffusion as ammonia.
