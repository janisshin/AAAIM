Synonyms:
Gly: ['glycine', 'aminoacetic acid', '2-aminoethanoic acid']
FA: ['formic acid', 'methanoic acid', 'hydrogen carboxylic acid']
AA: ['acetic acid', 'ethanoic acid', 'methanecarboxylic acid']
Glu: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'dextrose']
MG: ['methylglyoxal', 'pyruvaldehyde', '2-oxopropanal']

Reason: The model is based on the kinetic modeling of Amadori degradation pathways, and the species names can be inferred from the context of the reactions and the notes. Gly is likely glycine, an amino acid, due to its involvement in the reactions. FA is likely formic acid, a common degradation product, and AA is likely acetic acid, another degradation product. Glu is likely glucose, a carbohydrate, given its relationship with other carbohydrate-related species. MG is likely methylglyoxal, a known degradation product of glucose.
