Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding display names and then standardized to common chemical names or synonyms. For species "Nb", no clear match was found, so it was labeled as "UNK". The model context and display names were used to disambiguate species with similar names, such as "Gly3P" and "Gly3Pg", which both refer to glycerol 3-phosphate but in different cellular compartments.
