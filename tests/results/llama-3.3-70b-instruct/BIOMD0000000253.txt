Synonyms:
HMP: ['hexose phosphate', '6-phosphohexose', 'hexose monophosphate']
Fru16P2: ['fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'fructose-1,6-diphosphate', 'F1,6BP']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
Glc: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'dextrose']
Tre6P: ['trehalose 6-phosphate', 'alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate', 'trehalose-6-phosphate']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]

Reason: The model is a representation of glycolysis, a well-studied metabolic pathway. The display names and reactions provided match the expected biochemical reactions and intermediates of glycolysis. HMP is likely hexose monophosphate, which is an intermediate in the pathway. Fru16P2 is clearly fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, a key intermediate in glycolysis. ATP and ADP are standard energy currency molecules in cells. Glc is glucose, the starting material for glycolysis. Tre6P is trehalose 6-phosphate, which is mentioned in the notes as related to the model, but not directly involved in the reactions provided.
