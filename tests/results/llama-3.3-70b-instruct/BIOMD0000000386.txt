Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose 1,5-diphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'phosphoglycerate']
NADPH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'NADPH']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid']
O2: ['oxygen', 'dioxygen', 'molecular oxygen']

Reason: The model is of the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is a part of photosynthesis, and the reactions provided match the known biochemical reactions of this cycle. RuBP is a substrate for the RuBisCO enzyme, PGA is a product of the Calvin cycle, NADPH is a reducing agent, CO2 is the carbon source for the cycle, and O2 is a byproduct of photosynthesis. The display names provided in the model match the common names for these species, and the standardized names are based on common biochemical nomenclature.
