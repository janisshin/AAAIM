Synonyms:
r5: ['Rab5-GDP', 'Ras-related protein Rab-5', 'GDP-bound Rab5']
R5: ['Rab5-GTP', 'Ras-related protein Rab-5 GTP-bound', 'GTP-bound Rab5']
r7: ['Rab7-GDP', 'Ras-related protein Rab-7', 'GDP-bound Rab7']
R7: ['Rab7-GTP', 'Ras-related protein Rab-7 GTP-bound', 'GTP-bound Rab7']

Reason: The display names and reactions suggest that r5 and R5 are related to Rab5, a small GTPase, and r7 and R7 are related to Rab7, another small GTPase, with the suffixes -GDP and -GTP indicating the bound nucleotide state.
