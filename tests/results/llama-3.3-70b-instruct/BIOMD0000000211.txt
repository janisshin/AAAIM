Reason: The model is a glycolytic pathway model, and most of the species have display names that match common biochemical compounds. The reactions and notes provide additional context for identifying the species. For example, species_1 is identified as pyruvate based on its display name and its involvement in the reaction "vPT: species_1 => $species_26". Some species, such as species_6 and species_13, are identified as cyclic AMP and AMP, respectively, based on their display names, but may not be directly related to the glycolytic pathway. Species_19 and species_20 are identified as NAD and NADH, respectively, based on their display names and their roles as electron carriers in the glycolytic pathway.
