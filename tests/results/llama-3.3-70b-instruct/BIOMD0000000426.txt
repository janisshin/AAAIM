Reason: The species names were matched to standardized names based on their display names and the context of the model, which appears to be a metabolic model of central carbon metabolism. The matches were made using common biochemical nomenclature and the provided display names. Some species, such as species_9, were given additional context to distinguish them from other similar species (e.g., glucose).
