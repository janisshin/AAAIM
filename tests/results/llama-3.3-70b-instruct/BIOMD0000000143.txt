NADP2_c: ['UNK']

Reason: The species were annotated based on their display names and the context of the model, which describes the oscillatory metabolism of activated neutrophils. The display names provided a clear indication of the chemical identity of most species. However, NADP2_c was annotated as "UNK" because its display name is the same as NADP_c, but its reactions suggest it might be a dimer or a different state of NADP, which is not a standard chemical entity.
