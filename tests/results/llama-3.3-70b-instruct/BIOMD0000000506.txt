Reason: The model is related to fatty acid Î²-oxidation, and most species have names that match the pattern of acyl-CoA derivatives, which are intermediates in this process. The names are constructed based on the chain length and functional group of the acyl moiety. Some species, like FADHMAT and NADHMAT, are electron carriers, while others, like CoAMAT and CoACYT, are coenzyme A and its derivatives. Species without clear matches to known biochemicals are annotated as "UNK".
