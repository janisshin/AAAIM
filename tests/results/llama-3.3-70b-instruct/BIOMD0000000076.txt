Synonyms:
G3P: ['glycerol 3-phosphate', 'D-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'sn-glycerol 3-phosphate']
Gly: ['glycerol', 'glycerin', 'propane-1,2,3-triol']
DHAP: ['dihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'DHAP', '3-hydroxy-2-oxopropyl phosphate']

Reason: The display names provided in the model directly map to standardized names for G3P and Gly, while DHAP is a common abbreviation for dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a metabolite involved in glycerol synthesis, which is consistent with the model's context.
