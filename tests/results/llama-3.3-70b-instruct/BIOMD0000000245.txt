Synonyms:
s_glu: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
s_pyr: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
s_acetald: ['acetaldehyde', 'ethanal', 'acetic aldehyde']
s_EtOH: ['ethanol', 'ethyl alcohol', 'alcohol']
CO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'carbonic acid gas']
Red: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
S_f: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']

Reason: The species names were matched to their display names and then standardized to common chemical names. s_glu and S_f are both glucose, s_pyr is pyruvic acid, s_acetald is acetaldehyde, s_EtOH is ethanol, CO2 is carbon dioxide, and Red is likely NADH based on the context of the reaction equations and the model description.
