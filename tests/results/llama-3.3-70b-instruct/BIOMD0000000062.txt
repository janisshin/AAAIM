Model: BIOMD0000000062
LLM: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct
Timestamp: 2025-06-03 11:46:42

Synonyms:
Ts: ['tryptophan', 'L-tryptophan', 'tryptophan amino acid']
Tt: ['tryptophan', 'total tryptophan', 'tryptophan concentration']

Reason: Ts and Tt are annotated based on their display names, with Ts being "Synthesized tryptophan" and Tt being "Total tryptophan", indicating they are related to tryptophan, a common amino acid. The model context "Bhartiya2003_Tryptophan_operon" also supports this annotation, as it suggests the model is related to the tryptophan operon, a genetic regulatory system involved in tryptophan biosynthesis.
