Synonyms:
Ca_i_cytosolic_calcium: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_lum: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: Both Ca_i_cytosolic_calcium and Ca_lum are likely to represent calcium ions, given the context of the model and the reactions, which describe the dynamics of calcium concentrations in different cellular compartments. The lack of more specific information about the species does not allow for more precise identification.
