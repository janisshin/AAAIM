Synonyms:
AR_A1: ['alkylresorcinol', 'resorcinol', '1,3-benzenediol']
AR_A2: ['alkylresorcinol', 'resorcinol', '1,3-benzenediol']
AR_Central: ['alkylresorcinol', 'resorcinol', '1,3-benzenediol']
AR_Dose: ['UNK']

Reason: All species except AR_Dose are annotated as "AR" which likely refers to alkylresorcinol, a compound that can be found in wheat bran and other foods. AR_Dose is unknown because it is an input dose and does not directly correspond to a chemical entity.
