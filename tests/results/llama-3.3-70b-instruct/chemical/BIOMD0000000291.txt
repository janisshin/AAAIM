Synonyms:
x2: ['bilirubin', 'bilirubin albumin complex']
x3: ['albumin bilirubin complex', 'bilirubin albumin complex']
x6: ['bilirubin', 'bilirubin ion', 'bilirubin molecule']
x7: ['carbon', 'carbon surface', 'activated carbon']
B0: ['UNK']
C0: ['UNK']

Reason: x2, x3, x6, and x7 are annotated based on their display names and the context of the model, which involves the binding of albumin-bilirubin complex to a carbon pyropolymer surface. B0 and C0 are unknown because their display names do not provide any information about their chemical identity.
