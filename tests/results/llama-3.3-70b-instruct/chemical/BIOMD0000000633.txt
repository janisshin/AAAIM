Synonyms:
glc_ext: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood glucose']
lac_ext: ['lactate', 'lactic acid', 'L-lactate']
glc: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'glucose molecule']
bpg13: ['UNK']
lac: ['lactate', 'lactic acid', 'L-lactate']
glc_er: ['glucose', 'endoplasmic reticulum glucose', 'glucose in endoplasmic reticulum']

Reason: The model is about hepatic glucose metabolism, so glc_ext and glc are likely to be glucose, lac_ext and lac are likely to be lactate, and glc_er is likely to be glucose in a specific cellular compartment. bpg13 has no clear relation to known biochemical entities, so it is annotated as "UNK".
