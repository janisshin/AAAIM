Synonyms:
Cytosolic_Rapamycin: ['sirolimus', 'rapamycin', 'Rapamune']
mTOR_Rapamycin: ['UNK']
mTORC1_Rapamycin: ['UNK']

Reason: Cytosolic_Rapamycin is likely referring to the drug rapamycin in its cytosolic form, hence the standardized names are sirolimus, rapamycin, and Rapamune. mTOR_Rapamycin and mTORC1_Rapamycin are complexes and not chemical entities, therefore they are unknown (UNK).
