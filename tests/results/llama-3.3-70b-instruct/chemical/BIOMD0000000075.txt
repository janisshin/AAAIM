Synonyms:
PIP2_PHGFP_PM: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PIP2', '1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate']
IP3_PHGFP_Cyt: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
PIP2_PM: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PIP2', '1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate']
DAG_PM: ['1,2-diacylglycerol', 'DAG', 'diglyceride']
IP3X_Cytosol: ['UNK']
IP3_Cyt: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']

Reason: The model is about phosphoinositide turnover, and the display names and notes suggest that PIP2 and IP3 are phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate respectively. DAG is likely 1,2-diacylglycerol, a product of PIP2 hydrolysis. IP3X_Cytosol has no clear definition or reaction, so it is annotated as "UNK".
