Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium', 'Ca(2+)', 'calcium ion']
Z: ['calcium', 'Ca(2+)', 'calcium ion']
Y: ['calcium', 'Ca(2+)', 'calcium ion']

Reason: The model is described as a "Calcium Oscillation" model and the reactions involve the transformation of EC, Z, and Y, which are likely to be different forms or locations of calcium ions in the cell, given the context of the model and the notes provided.
