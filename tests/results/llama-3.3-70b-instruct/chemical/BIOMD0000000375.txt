Synonyms:
Ca_er_Ca_equations: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_i: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: Both Ca_er_Ca_equations and Ca_i are likely referring to calcium, as the model is about calcium release-activated current in pancreatic beta-cells and the display names and reactions suggest calcium is being tracked in different compartments (endoplasmic reticulum and intracellular).
