Reason: The model is a glycolysis model, and most of the species are intermediates or cofactors in the glycolytic pathway. The display names and reactions provide additional context for identifying the species. For example, F16bP is identified as "fructose-1,6-bisphosphate" based on the reaction "PFK: ATP + F6P => ADP + F16bP", which is a well-known step in glycolysis. Similarly, PYRmito is identified as "pyruvate" based on the reaction "PDC: PYR => AcAld + $CO2", which is also a well-known step in glycolysis. Some species, such as GLCo and GLCi, are identified as "glucose" based on their names and the context of the model. CO2mito is identified as "carbon dioxide" based on its name and the reaction "PDH: PYRmito => $AcCoA + $CO2mito". AcCoA is identified as "acetyl-CoA" based on its name and the reaction "PDH: PYRmito => $AcCoA + $CO2mito".
