Synonyms:
X_gut: ['caffeine', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine', 'theophylline']
C_p: ['caffeine', '1,3,7-trimethylxanthine', 'caffeine, serum']
C_per: ['caffeine, peripheral compartment', 'caffeine, tissue', 'caffeine, peripheral']
C_e: ['caffeine, effect compartment', 'caffeine, effective concentration', 'caffeine, biophase']
C_t: ['caffeine, tolerant compartment', 'caffeine, tolerance', 'caffeine, adapted']

Reason: The model is a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of caffeine, and the species names are likely related to different compartments or states of caffeine in the body. X_gut is likely caffeine in the gut, C_p is caffeine in the plasma, C_per is caffeine in the peripheral compartment, C_e is caffeine in the effect compartment, and C_t is caffeine in the tolerant compartment. The standardized names are based on common synonyms for caffeine and its related compartments.
