FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBP']
NADHm: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
Cam: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']
ADPm: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
adp: ['ADP', 'adenosine diphosphate', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]

Caer: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']

Reason: The species names were matched to their corresponding biochemical compounds based on common abbreviations and names used in the context of cellular metabolism and the provided model description. G6P and FBP are intermediates in glycolysis, NADHm is a reduced electron carrier, Cam and c likely refer to calcium ions in different compartments, ADPm and adp are adenosine diphosphate in different contexts, and Caer also refers to calcium ions. The ranking of names is based on the most common or standardized names used in biochemical literature.
