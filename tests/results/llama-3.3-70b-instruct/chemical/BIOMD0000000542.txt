Synonyms:
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP(3-)', "5'-adenylic acid"]
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP(4-)', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: The model provides display names for ADP and ATP, which are standard abbreviations for adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, respectively. The reactions also involve energy transfer, which is consistent with the role of ATP and ADP in cellular metabolism. The standardized names and common synonyms are based on the ChEBI ontology.
