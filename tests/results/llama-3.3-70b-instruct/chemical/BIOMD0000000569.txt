Synonyms:
glu: ['glutamic acid', 'glutamate', 'L-glutamic acid']

Reason: The model appears to be related to AMPA receptors and glutamatergic hippocampal neurons, and "glu" is a common abbreviation for glutamic acid or glutamate in biochemical contexts. The reactions also suggest that "glu" is a substrate or ligand, which is consistent with the role of glutamate as a neurotransmitter.
