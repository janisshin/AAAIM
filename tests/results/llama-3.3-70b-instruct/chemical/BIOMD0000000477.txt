Synonyms:
mw05469f51_73f7_4ba1_9f1a_bce5fea143c2: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PIP2', 'phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate']
mwf20834c8_a115_460b_859c_4e3ca1ffd953: ['1,2-diacylglycerol', 'DAG', 'diglyceride']

Reason: The display names provided directly map mw05469f51_73f7_4ba1_9f1a_bce5fea143c2 to 'PIP2' and mwf20834c8_a115_460b_859c_4e3ca1ffd953 to 'DAG', which are standard abbreviations for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, respectively. The reactions further support these identifications, as PIP2 is known to be hydrolyzed to DAG by phospholipase C (PLC), which is consistent with the reaction 'mw05368c46_8a41_4609_b904_25219691464b'.
