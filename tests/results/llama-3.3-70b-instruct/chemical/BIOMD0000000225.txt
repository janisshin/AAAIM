Synonyms:
GLC: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
G6P_F6P: ['glucose-6-phosphate', 'D-glucose-6-phosphate', 'G6P']
F6P: ['fructose-6-phosphate', 'D-fructose-6-phosphate', 'F6P']
FBP: ['fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate', 'FBP']
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', 'G3P']

Reason: The model is a glycolytic model, and the reactions and display names suggest that the species are intermediates in the glycolytic pathway. GLC is likely glucose, the starting material, and G6P_F6P is likely glucose-6-phosphate, the product of the first step. F6P, FBP, and G3P are subsequent intermediates in the pathway, and their names match their display names.
