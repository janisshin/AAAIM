Synonyms:
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'G3P', '3-phosphoglyceraldehyde']
PYR: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
ATP: ["adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
NADHm: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
NADHc: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
Cam: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: The model is a biochemical model of glucose sensitivity in pancreatic beta cells, and the species names are likely to be related to the biochemical processes involved. G3P is likely glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a intermediate in glycolysis. PYR is likely pyruvic acid, the end product of glycolysis. ATP is likely adenosine 5'-triphosphate, the energy currency of the cell. NADHm and NADHc are likely nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a electron carrier involved in energy metabolism, with the 'm' and 'c' suffixes possibly indicating mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments. Cam is likely calcium, an important ion in cellular signaling and metabolism.
