Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']
Z: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca(2+)']
A: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'inositol trisphosphate']
Y: ['UNK']

Reason: EC and Z are likely to be calcium as the model is based on calcium oscillation and CICR, and the reactions show a cycle between EC and Z. A is likely to be inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) as the model takes into account the Ca(2+)-activated degradation of IP3. Y is unknown as there is no information provided about its reactants or products.
