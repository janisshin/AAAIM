LRGt: ['ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptor-G protein complex', 'active GPCR-G complex', 'agonist-bound GPCR-G complex']
RGd: ['regulator of G protein signaling-inactive G protein complex', 'RGS-inactive G complex', 'inhibitory G protein complex']
RGt: ['regulator of G protein signaling-G protein complex', 'RGS-G complex', 'G protein-regulator complex']

Reason: The model appears to describe a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, with species representing different states of G proteins and their complexes with receptors and regulators. The names are based on the context of the model and the notes provided, which mention GPCR, G protein, and regulator of G protein signaling (RGS). The likelihood of each name is ranked based on the relevance to the model and the standard terminology used in the field.
