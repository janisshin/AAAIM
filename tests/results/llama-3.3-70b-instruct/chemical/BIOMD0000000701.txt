Reason: Tem1GTP and Tem1GDP can be identified as GTP and GDP respectively, which are common biochemical molecules. The other species contain protein names (Tem1, Bfa1) and post-translational modifications (GTP, GDP, P4, P5), but without more context or display names, they cannot be mapped to standardized chemical names.
