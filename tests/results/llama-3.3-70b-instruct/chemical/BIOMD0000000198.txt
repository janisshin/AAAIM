Synonyms:
NO: ['nitric oxide', 'nitrogen oxide', 'nitrogen monoxide']
NO_sGCfast: ['UNK']
NO_sGCfast_6coord: ['UNK']
NO_sGCfast_5coord: ['UNK']
NO_sGCslow: ['UNK']
NO_sGCslow_6coord: ['UNK']
NO_sGCslow_6coord_NO_int: ['UNK']
NO_sGCslow_5coord: ['UNK']
NO_sGC_5coord_tot: ['UNK']
sGC_inact_tot: ['UNK']

Reason: The only species that can be identified with certainty is NO, which is a well-known chemical entity. The other species appear to be related to the interaction of NO with soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), but their names do not provide enough information to determine their chemical structure or identity, so they are labeled as "UNK".
