Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', 'AMP', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]

Reason: The species ATP, ADP, and AMP are all well-known biochemical compounds involved in energy transfer within cells, and their display names in the model match their common chemical names. The reactions listed also involve these species in typical biochemical processes, such as the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and the production of AMP, further confirming their identities.
