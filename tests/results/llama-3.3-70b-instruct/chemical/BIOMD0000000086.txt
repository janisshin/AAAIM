Synonyms:
species_3: ['threonine', 'T', 'L-threonine']
species_5: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
species_6: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
species_7: ['phosphate', 'inorganic phosphate', 'orthophosphate']
species_8: ['UNK']
species_10: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
species_11: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
species_12: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
species_13: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
species_15: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
species_16: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]

Reason: The model appears to be related to GTPase cycles and signal transduction. The display names suggest involvement of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) and GDP (guanosine diphosphate), which are common molecules in such cycles. The presence of "T" for species_3 and "Pi" for species_7 suggests threonine and inorganic phosphate, respectively. The lack of clear information for species_8 results in "UNK". The asterisk (*) in some display names likely indicates an activated or modified state, but without further context, the base molecule (GTP or GDP) is assumed.
