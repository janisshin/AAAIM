Synonyms:
IPTG: ['isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside', 'isopropylthiogalactoside', 'IPTG']

Reason: IPTG is a commonly used inducer molecule in molecular biology, and its full name is isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, with isopropylthiogalactoside being a synonym; the model notes confirm its use as an inducer in the context of the sigma B proteolysis model.
