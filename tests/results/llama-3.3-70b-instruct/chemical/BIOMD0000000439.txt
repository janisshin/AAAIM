Synonyms:
GaGTP: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
RGSGaGTP: ['UNK']
GaGDPP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
GaGTPEffector: ['UNK']
inertGaGTP: ['GTP', 'guanosine triphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
RGSinertGaGTP: ['UNK']
GaGDP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "Guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
P: ['phosphate', 'orthophosphate', 'phosphoric acid']

Reason: GaGTP and inertGaGTP are likely GTP due to the display name and reaction involvement, GaGDPP and GaGDP are likely GDP due to the reaction sequence, P is likely phosphate due to the reaction producing GaGDP + P, RGSGaGTP, GaGTPEffector, and RGSinertGaGTP are unknown due to lack of clear chemical information in the display names and reactions.
