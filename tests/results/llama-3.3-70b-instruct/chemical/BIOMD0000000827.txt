Synonyms:
X_7_MET_MET: ['MET protein', 'hepatocyte growth factor receptor', 'MET proto-oncogene']
X_10_p_MET_MET: ['phosphorylated MET', 'p-MET', 'MET phosphoprotein']

Reason: The model is based on the MET gene amplification and its role in gefitinib resistance, X_7_MET_MET is likely the MET protein dimer, and X_10_p_MET_MET is likely the phosphorylated form of the MET protein, as indicated by the "p-" prefix in its display name and its involvement in phosphorylation reactions.
