Synonyms:
Ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
PP2BinactiveCa2: ['UNK']
cAMP: ['cyclic AMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate", 'cAMP']
cAMP_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP2_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP3_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP4_R2C2: ['UNK']
cAMP4_R2C: ['UNK']
cAMP4_R2: ['UNK']
cAMP_PDE: ['cAMP-PDE complex', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-phosphodiesterase complex", 'cAMP-PDE']
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', 'AMP', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]
cAMP_PDEP: ['UNK']

Reason: Ca is likely calcium due to its symbol and common usage in biochemical models. cAMP is a well-known molecule with a standardized name. AMP is a common abbreviation for adenosine monophosphate. PP2BinactiveCa2, cAMP_R2C2, cAMP2_R2C2, cAMP3_R2C2, cAMP4_R2C2, cAMP4_R2C, cAMP4_R2, and cAMP_PDEP are unknown or unsure due to lack of clear information or standardized names. cAMP_PDE is likely a complex of cAMP and phosphodiesterase, but its exact name may vary.
