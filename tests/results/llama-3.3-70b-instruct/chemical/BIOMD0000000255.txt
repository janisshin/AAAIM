Synonyms:
c2: ['Adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', 'Triphosphoric acid']
c3: ['Epidermal growth factor', 'EGF', 'Urogastrone']
c500: ['UNK']
c4: ['Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'ErbB1', 'HER1']
c10: ['Epidermal growth factor', 'EGF', 'Urogastrone']
c11: ['Epidermal growth factor', 'EGF', 'Urogastrone']
c106: ['Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate', 'PIP3', 'Phosphoinositide']
c285: ['Inhibitor', 'UNK', 'UNK']
c462: ['Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate', 'PIP3', 'Phosphoinositide']

Reason: The display names provide direct information about the species, allowing for straightforward mapping to standardized names. c500 is unknown due to its complex display name, which does not provide a clear indication of its chemical identity. c285 is also unknown as "Inh" is a common abbreviation for inhibitor, but without further context, it is difficult to determine the specific inhibitor being referred to.
