Synonyms:
SpeciesA: ['allolactose', '6-(β-D-galactopyranosyloxy)-hex-1-en-3-ulose', 'β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-D-glucose']
SpeciesL: ['lactose', 'milk sugar', 'β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose']
SpeciesL_e: ['lactose', 'milk sugar', 'β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose']

Reason: The display names and the model context suggest that A is allolactose, a metabolite derived from lactose, and L and L_e are lactose, with L_e being external lactose and L being internal lactose, all of which are involved in the lac operon regulation in Escherichia coli.
