Reason: The species are annotated based on their display names and the context of the trehalose biosynthesis model. The display names provide a clear indication of the chemical identity of each species, and the model reactions confirm these identities. For example, glc is clearly glucose, while udg is UDP-glucose. The reactions also provide evidence for the identities of t6p and trh as trehalose 6-phosphate and trehalose, respectively. The other species are annotated based on their common biochemical names and the context of the model.
