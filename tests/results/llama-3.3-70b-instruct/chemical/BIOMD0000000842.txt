Synonyms:
PIP2: ['phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate', 'PtdIns(4,5)P2', '1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate']
DAG: ['1,2-diacylglycerol', 'diglyceride', 'diacylglycerol']

Reason: PIP2 is likely "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate" due to its role in the GPCR signaling pathway, where it is hydrolyzed to form DAG. DAG is likely "1,2-diacylglycerol" as it is a common product of PIP2 hydrolysis. The reaction equations and display names support these identifications.
