Synonyms:
G1: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T1: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
G2: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
T2: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: The display names and the model context suggest that G1 and G2 are glucose, and T1 and T2 are ATP, which are key molecules in glycolysis, the process modeled by Bier2000_GlycolyticOscillation.
