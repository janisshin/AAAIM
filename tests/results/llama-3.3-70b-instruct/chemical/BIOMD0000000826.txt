Synonyms:
STAT3uStattic: ['STAT3', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3', 'STAT3 protein']

Reason: The species name 'STAT3uStattic' seems to be a modified or specific state of the STAT3 protein, possibly indicating an inhibited or ubiquitinated form, given the suffix 'u' which could imply ubiquitination and 'Stattic' which is a known inhibitor of STAT3, thus the standardized names provided are related to the STAT3 protein itself.
