Synonyms:
CaI: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium(2+)']
IP3: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']
CaO: ['UNK']
CaS: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium(2+)']
CaM: ['calmodulin', 'calcium-modulated protein', 'calcium-binding protein']

Reason: CaI and CaS are likely calcium ions based on the model context and reaction equations, IP3 is a well-known signaling molecule, CaM is likely calmodulin due to its role in calcium signaling, and CaO has no clear identification based on the provided information.
