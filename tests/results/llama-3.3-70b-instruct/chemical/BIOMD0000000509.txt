Synonyms:
ip3: ['inositol trisphosphate', 'inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']
atp: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
y: ['UNK']
ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: ip3 is likely inositol trisphosphate due to its common involvement in cell signaling pathways, atp is a well-known energy currency in cells, y has no clear identification in the model, and ca is likely calcium due to its mention in the model notes as being involved in cell cycle coupling.
