Synonyms:
G3P: ['glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate', '3-phosphoglyceraldehyde']
PYR: ['pyruvic acid', 'pyruvate', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
ATP: ["adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP', 'adenosine triphosphate']
NADHm: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen ion', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
NADHc: ['NADH', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen ion', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']
Cam: ['UNK']

Reason: G3P, PYR, ATP, NADHm, and NADHc can be identified based on their display names and the context of the model, which appears to be a metabolic model of glucose sensing in pancreatic beta cells. Cam cannot be identified due to lack of information in the display names and reactions.
