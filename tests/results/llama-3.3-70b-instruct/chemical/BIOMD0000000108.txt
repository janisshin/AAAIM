Synonyms:
species_0000001: ['superoxide', 'superoxide anion', 'O2*âˆ’']
species_0000006: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'H2O2', 'dihydrogen dioxide']
species_0000008: ['hydroxyl radical', 'HO*', 'hydroxyl']
species_0000009: ['lipid hydroperoxide', 'LOOH', 'alkyl hydroperoxide']

Reason: The species are identified based on their display names and reaction equations. species_0000001 is likely superoxide due to its reaction with Cu(II)ZnSOD, a known superoxide dismutase. species_0000006 is hydrogen peroxide, a common product of superoxide dismutation. species_0000008 is likely the hydroxyl radical, a highly reactive species that can be formed from hydrogen peroxide. species_0000009 is likely a lipid hydroperoxide, given its formation from the reaction of species_0000001 with species_0000007 (likely a lipid radical).
