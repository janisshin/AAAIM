Synonyms:
DRG_GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
G_GDP: ['GDP', 'guanosine diphosphate', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP', "guanosine 5'-diphosphate"]
DRG_GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]
G_GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP', "guanosine 5'-triphosphate"]

Reason: The reaction equations and display names suggest that these species are related to guanosine nucleotides, with DRG and G likely representing protein or complex prefixes, and GDP/GTP representing the guanosine diphosphate/triphosphate molecules, which are commonly involved in biochemical reactions, particularly G-protein signaling.
