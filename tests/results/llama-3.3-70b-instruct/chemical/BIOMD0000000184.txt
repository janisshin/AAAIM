Synonyms:
X: ['calcium(2+)', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
Y: ['calcium(2+)', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
Z: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3']

Reason: X and Y are likely "calcium(2+)" due to their display names and reaction involvement, indicating calcium ion movement between cytoplasm and ER. Z is identified as "inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate" based on its display name 'IP3', a common synonym for this molecule.
