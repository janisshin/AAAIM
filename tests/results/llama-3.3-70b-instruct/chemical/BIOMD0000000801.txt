Synonyms:
B: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood glucose']
S: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'serum glucose']

Reason: Based on the model reactions and notes, B and S are likely to represent glucose in different contexts. The reaction 'glucose_b_s: B => S' suggests a conversion from B to S, which could be from blood glucose (B) to serum glucose (S). The notes also mention "serum glucose levels" and "blood-based biomarkers", supporting this interpretation.
