Synonyms:
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate"]
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', 'AMP', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate"]
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate"]
NADH: ['nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen', 'NADH', 'reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide']

Reason: The model is about adenine nucleotides and the display names directly match common chemical names, making the annotations straightforward. NADH is also a well-known coenzyme and its annotation is based on common chemical names.
