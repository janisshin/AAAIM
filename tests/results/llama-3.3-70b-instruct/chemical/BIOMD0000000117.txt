Synonyms:
z: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
y: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: Both z and y are likely to represent calcium ions, as indicated by their display names and the context of the model, which involves Ca2+ oscillations and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The display names 'Ca in the cytosol' and 'Ca in the InsP3-insensitive pool' suggest that z and y represent calcium ions in different cellular compartments.
