Synonyms:
IPTG: ['isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside', 'isopropylthiogalactoside', 'IPTG']
A1: ['N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone', '3-oxo-C6-HSL', '3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone']
A2: ['N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone', '3-oxo-C8-HSL', '3-oxooctanoyl-L-homoserine lactone']

Reason: IPTG is a known chemical inducer, A1 and A2 are likely autoinducer molecules based on the context of the article, which mentions an Escherichia coli predator-prey ecosystem and AHLs (Autoinducer molecules), with A1 and A2 likely being N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone respectively.
