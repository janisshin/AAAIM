Synonyms:
x: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']
y: ['calcium ion', 'Ca2+', 'calcium']

Reason: The display names 'Ca_Cyt' and 'Ca_ER' suggest that 'x' and 'y' are related to calcium ions, with 'Ca_Cyt' likely referring to calcium in the cytosol and 'Ca_ER' referring to calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum. The reactions also indicate that 'x' and 'y' are interchangeable, further supporting the idea that they represent the same chemical entity, calcium ions.
