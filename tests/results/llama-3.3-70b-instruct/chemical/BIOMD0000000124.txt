Synonyms:
c: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
cer: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: Both 'c' and 'cer' are annotated with 'ca concentration', which is a common abbreviation for calcium concentration, indicating that they likely represent calcium ions in different cellular compartments, namely the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
