Synonyms:
sucr: ['sucrose', 'table sugar', 'saccharose']
Ephe: ['UNK']
N: ['nitrogen', 'nitrate', 'ammonia']
Next: ['UNK']
Enitrate: ['nitrate', 'nitric acid', 'nitrate ion']
ECO2: ['carbon dioxide', 'CO2', 'dioxide carbon']

Reason: sucr is likely sucrose due to the reaction names 'Sucrose_Formation_TrioseP' and 'Sucrose_Consumption_Ephe'. Ephe and Next are unknown as there are no clear indications of their chemical identities. N is likely related to nitrogen due to its formation and consumption reactions. Enitrate is likely nitrate due to its name and formation/consumption reactions. ECO2 is likely carbon dioxide due to its formation and consumption reactions, as well as the 'CO2' in its name.
