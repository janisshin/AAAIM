Synonyms:
ARGex: ['arginine', 'L-arginine', 'arginine(2+)']
ORN: ['ornithine', 'L-ornithine', 'ornithine(2+)']
ARGin: ['arginine', 'L-arginine', 'arginine(2+)']

Reason: ARGex and ARGin are likely to be the same chemical entity, arginine, with "ex" and "in" indicating extracellular and intracellular locations, respectively. ORN is identified as ornithine, a product of arginine catabolism, which is consistent with the model's description of arginine catabolism.
