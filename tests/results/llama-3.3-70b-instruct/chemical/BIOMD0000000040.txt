Synonyms:
Br: ['bromide', 'bromide ion', 'Br-']
BrO3: ['bromate', 'bromate ion', 'BrO3-']

Reason: The display names and reactions in the model suggest that Br and BrO3 are ions, and the model is a simulation of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, which involves bromide and bromate ions. The display names {'Br': 'Br-', 'BrO3': 'BrO3-'} also support this annotation.
