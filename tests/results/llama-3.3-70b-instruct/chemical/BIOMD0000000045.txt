Synonyms:
EC: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Z: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Y: ['calcium(2+)', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
X: ['inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'IP3', 'inositol trisphosphate']

Reason: The model is described as a Calcium Oscillation model based on CICR (Calcium-Induced Calcium Release) and two-pool model, suggesting that EC, Z, and Y are likely to be calcium ions. X is likely to be inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) as it is mentioned in the article as a key component in the model, involved in the Ca(2+)-activated degradation.
