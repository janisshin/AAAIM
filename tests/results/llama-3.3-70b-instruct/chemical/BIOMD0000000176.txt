Reason: The species were identified based on their display names and the reactions they participate in, which are typical of glycolysis and related metabolic pathways. The standardized names and common synonyms were chosen based on their common usage in biochemical literature and databases such as ChEBI. For species with no display name, the reaction participation and pathway context were used to infer their identity.
