Synonyms:
B: ['calcitriol', '1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3', '1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol']
P: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
T: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
R: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
Q: ['bone calcium', 'calcium in bone', 'bone Ca2+']
Qbone: ['bone calcium', 'calcium in bone', 'bone Ca2+']

Reason: The model is a calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling model, and the reactions and notes suggest that B is calcitriol, a hormone involved in calcium regulation. P, T, and R are likely calcium or calcium ions, given their involvement in calcium flux and absorption reactions. Q and Qbone are likely related to calcium in bone, given their involvement in bone-related reactions.
