Synonyms:
CaER: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']
Ca_Cyt: ['calcium', 'Ca2+', 'calcium ion']

Reason: The model is related to calcium oscillations, and the reactions involve the movement of CaER and Ca_Cyt, suggesting they represent calcium ions in different compartments, likely the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol (Cyt), respectively.
