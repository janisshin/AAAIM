Synonyms:
RuBP: ['ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate', 'RuBP', 'ribulose 1,5-diphosphate']
PGA: ['3-phosphoglycerate', '3-phosphoglyceric acid', 'phosphoglycerate']
Ru5P: ['ribulose-5-phosphate', 'ribulose phosphate', 'ru5p']
Pi: ['inorganic phosphate', 'phosphate', 'orthophosphate']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', 'ATP', "adinosine 5'-triphosphate"]
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', 'ADP', "adinosine 5'-diphosphate"]
Pic: ['UNK']

Reason: The model is of the Calvin-Benson cycle, a photosynthetic process in plants. RuBP, PGA, Ru5P, Pi, ATP, and ADP are all known intermediates or cofactors in this cycle, with well-established chemical names. Pic has no clear definition or reaction in the provided model, making its identity uncertain.
