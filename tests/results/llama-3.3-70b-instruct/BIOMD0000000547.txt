Synonyms:
species_6: ['arsenic(III) ion', 'arsenite', 'arsenous acid']
species_4: ['S-(arsenic(III))glutathione', 'arsenic triglutathione', 'arsenite glutathione conjugate']
species_3: ['S-(arsenic(III))glutathione', 'arsenic triglutathione', 'arsenite glutathione conjugate']
species_1: ['arsenic(III) ion', 'arsenite', 'arsenous acid']
species_2: ['protein-bound arsenic(III)', 'arsenite protein complex', 'arsenic(III) protein conjugate']
species_7: ['glutathione', 'GSH', 'gamma-glutamylcysteinylglycine']

Reason: The model describes arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms in yeast, and the display names and reactions suggest that the species are related to arsenic and glutathione. species_1, species_2, and species_6 are likely related to arsenite, species_3 and species_4 are likely related to glutathione conjugates of arsenite, and species_7 is clearly glutathione. The standardized names are based on the chemical structures and common synonyms in the field of biochemistry.
