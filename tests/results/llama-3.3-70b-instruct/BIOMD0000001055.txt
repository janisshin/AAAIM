Synonyms:
Glucose: ['glucose', 'D-glucose', 'blood sugar']
Phosphoenolpyruvate: ['phosphoenolpyruvate', 'PEP', '2-phosphoenolpyruvate']
Pyruvate: ['pyruvate', 'pyruvic acid', '2-oxopropanoic acid']
Oxaloacetate: ['oxaloacetate', 'oxaloacetic acid', '2-oxobutanedioic acid']

Reason: The model is related to glucose metabolism, and the reactions provided show the conversion of glucose to various intermediates, including phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate, which are then converted to oxaloacetate, a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle. The display names and reactions support the identification of these species as common biochemical compounds.
