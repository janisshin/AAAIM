Synonyms:
species_1: ['dietary cholesterol', 'cholesterol', 'bile cholesterol']
species_2: ['intestinal cholesterol', 'cholesterol', 'bile cholesterol']
species_7: ['cholesterol ester', 'cholesteryl ester', 'esterified cholesterol']
species_8: ['cholesterol ether', 'ether cholesterol', 'UNK']
species_11: ['phosphatidylcholine', 'lecithin', 'phospholipid']
species_13: ['cholesterol ester', 'cholesteryl ester', 'esterified cholesterol']
species_14: ['acetyl-CoA acyltransferase', 'ACAT', 'thiolase']
species_28: ['phosphatidylethanolamine', 'cephalin', 'UNK']

Reason: The model appears to be related to cholesterol metabolism, with species_1 and species_2 likely representing dietary and intestinal cholesterol, respectively. Species_7 is probably a cholesterol ester, given its involvement in reactions with other cholesterol-related species. Species_8 is unclear, but may represent a cholesterol ether. Species_11 is likely phosphatidylcholine, a type of phospholipid. Species_13 is probably another cholesterol ester. Species_14 is likely the enzyme acetyl-CoA acyltransferase (ACAT). Species_28 is possibly phosphatidylethanolamine, but the evidence is not strong.
