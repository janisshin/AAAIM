Synonyms:
incAMP: ['cyclic AMP', 'cAMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"]
excAMP: ['cAMP', 'cyclic AMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"]

Reason: incAMP and excAMP are likely referring to intracellular and extracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a common signaling molecule in biological systems, given the context of the model "Ma2002_cAMP_oscillations" and the mention of oscillations, which is consistent with the role of cAMP in cellular signaling.
