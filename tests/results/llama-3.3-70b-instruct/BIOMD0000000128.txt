Synonyms:
c: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
cer: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']
cAMP: ['cyclic AMP', "adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate", 'cAMP']

Reason: c and cer are likely referring to calcium concentrations, with c being cytosolic calcium and cer being ER calcium, as indicated by their display names. cAMP is a well-known molecule with a standardized name, and its display name is empty but its common name is widely recognized.
