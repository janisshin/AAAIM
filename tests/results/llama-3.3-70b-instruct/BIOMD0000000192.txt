Synonyms:
RCC1_RanGDP: ['RCC1-Ran-GDP complex', 'RanGDP-RCC1 complex']
GDP: ['guanosine diphosphate', 'GDP']
RCC1_RanGTP: ['RCC1-Ran-GTP complex', 'RanGTP-RCC1 complex']
GTP: ['guanosine triphosphate', 'GTP']

Reason: The species names are annotated based on the context of the model, which describes a RanGTP gradient and regulators of RanGTPase, suggesting that RCC1_RanGDP and RCC1_RanGTP are complexes of RCC1 with GDP and GTP-bound Ran, respectively, while GDP and GTP are standardized names for guanosine diphosphate and guanosine triphosphate.
