Reason: Most species are annotated based on their display names, which often contain common synonyms or standardized names. Species without clear display names or those that are part of large complexes are annotated as "UNK" due to uncertainty. Reactions are used to inform annotations, but are not always sufficient to determine the exact identity of a species.
