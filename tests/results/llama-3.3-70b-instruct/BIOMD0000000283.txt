Synonyms:
X: ['UNK']
P: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'peroxide']
Q: ['peroxidase', 'enzyme-substrate compound']

Reason: X has no display name or reaction information that can be linked to a specific chemical entity, so it is annotated as "UNK". P is likely "hydrogen peroxide" because the model is described in the context of peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide kinetics. Q is likely "peroxidase" or "enzyme-substrate compound" because it is involved in a reaction with P (hydrogen peroxide) and is mentioned in the context of enzyme-substrate kinetics.
