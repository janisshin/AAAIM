Synonyms:
x: ['hydrogen peroxide', 'hydrogen peroxide (oxidizer)', 'H2O2']
p: ['catalase-hydrogen peroxide complex', 'enzyme-substrate complex', 'ES complex']
p1: ['water', 'H2O', 'dihydrogen monoxide']
p2: ['oxygen', 'O2', 'molecular oxygen']
a: ['electron donor', 'AH2', 'reduced electron donor']

Reason: The species x is identified as hydrogen peroxide from the display name, p is the enzyme-substrate complex, p1 and p2 are likely products of the catalase reaction, which breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, and a is an electron donor, likely a reduced compound, but its exact identity is not specified in the model.
