Synonyms:
Gd: ['GDP-bound G-alpha', 'G-alpha-GDP', 'guanine diphosphate-bound G-alpha']
Ga: ['GTP-bound G-alpha', 'G-alpha-GTP', 'guanine triphosphate-bound G-alpha']

Reason: The display names and reactions suggest that Gd and Ga are related to the G protein cycle, specifically the alpha subunit bound to GDP or GTP, respectively. The reactions show the interconversion between these states, consistent with the G protein activation and deactivation cycle.
